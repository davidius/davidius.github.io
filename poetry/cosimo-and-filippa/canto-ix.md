# Canto IX
Now northward of the Alps there was a man\\
With five and twenty thousand men in tow;\\
His name was Charles the Eighth of France, and like\\
The ancient one of Carthage sought to cross\\
With horse and man unbruised, to take his claim. \\
He grabbed his sword to give the look of war,\\
Then in most thunderous voice he made this speech:\\
‘You men of France, you warlike souls of steel!\\
Your hearts cannot be steeled the more, and yet—\\
As though to fix you in your holy mission—\\
Since hell is worse than all our torments here,\\
And heaven but admits the fighting brave\\
I say I give not Naples up for lost.\\
For what is honoured name and fortune earned\\
If one discordant apple takes it all?\\
And what is Rome, I ask, if Gaul invades\\
And takes it in a day? And what are crowns,\\
And all symbolic fineries of state—\\
I say what is the Valois House of Anjou\\
That from its basket might be plucked its fruit?\\
I will not say “I love you” if I hate,\\
And will not praise where all contempt is due,\\
Therefore we fight for very definition,\\
Without which meaning dies a sorry death.’\\
This speech was followed by uncertain silence\\
Throughout the army’s ranks; but seeing clear\\
That he was done, they all together cheered.\\
The king did then conclude the pause to be\\
Consideration of profundity,\\
And with a silent grace his troops he thanked.\\
\\
There was a soldier in the lower ranks\\
Was named Alceste, who at the sound of Charles\\
Was as a lover charged immovable.\\
His sword he gripped, for something to possess,\\
And willed the foe appear from mountain air\\
That he might sate his energies. The sound\\
Of trumpets blown then cured his legs of ache,\\
And as the army started slow to move,\\
Though being nothing of a general,\\
He moved ahead to have the honour first\\
To kill. Great luck then blessed his fortune dark;\\
For at the mere beginning of the path\\
That takes one over to the Aosta valley,\\
He spied young Cosimo with the musicians,\\
The whistler and the starving horse, and saw\\
Italians all, and thus he drew his sword.\\
The band of exiles saw Alceste and heard,\\
Some distance still away, an army march.\\
In sudden fear withdrawing now away—\\
Alas—beside Alceste their speed was none,\\
And soon he caught the bearded whistler.\\
‘Return, you sun-dried Lombard vegetables!\\
Have you no national pride, to scuttle off\\
On seeing a manly Frenchman wave his sword?\\
Or, what is worse, to see this white-beard caught\\
And offer not to draw your sword and fight?’\\
Now all the band was without aid of sword,\\
So Cosimo said: ‘Please, noble sir, refrain!\\
We have no weapons here, nor skill to fight,\\
Nor will to do a single cut of harm.\\
You hate the place from which I have been banished,\\
And sure you have your reasons, as do I,\\
But drawing guiltless blood is curse not cure.\\
Our lives are in the gloried heaven’s hands\\
Which crown and kill on higher laws than ours;\\
So let each place do as its station is,\\
And let us pass along, no harm to you.’\\
But still Alceste stood poised with sword to kill,\\
And raised obscenities against a nation\\
Wherewith to raise some ire and so make sweet\\
The victory foreseen. Now Cosimo\\
Began to plot, but seeing more French troops\\
Along the path, uncoiling like a python,\\
He hoped some intervention might arrive.\\
Foremost among the soldiers was the king,\\
Upon a noble rare Arabian horse,\\
Who spied the scene with curiosity,\\
And sought his kinglike nature to impose\\
That he might show his troops his acumen.\\
\\
‘What is this broiling scuffle that I see?\\
What halts the onward passage of our men—\\
What means this sword-drawn misdirected passion?\\
Sir, speak.’—contended Charles, to which Alceste:\\
‘Most royal highness, this collective here\\
Did walk as turtles caught by eye of hawk,\\
And, being Italian, thought to escape—\\
Escape!—By God in heaven this is not\\
What we in France call honour. I have a brother\\
At home, adulterous in the extreme,\\
Who worries all the village with his antics,\\
Yet still there’s more of honour there than all\\
Of Italy. My lord I only did\\
What you or one of your nobility\\
Might do when ached with such a sore, no more.’\\
The king deliberated with a frown\\
Of curiosity and deepest thought,\\
Then said: ‘Attend, respected sirs, to me.\\
Our fellow Frenchman has his honour hurt,\\
But these Italians are through their doublets\\
Cut up with shock. The both are double wrongs,\\
And must be set aright. I have a way:\\
There shall be picked from Italy a man—\\
That is, from you who stand before us now—\\
Who represents the country’s best perfection;\\
And he shall fight our noble Frenchman here.\\
As honour always wins, we soon shall know\\
The substance of your various complaints.’\\
Alceste believed this wisdom Solomonic,\\
So raised his sword and picked out Cosimo,\\
And spat aloud: ‘you sir, we two shall fight!’\\
Thus Cosimo replied: ‘your majesty,\\
Your treble-honoured noble highness, sir,\\
I must protest I am a peaceful man,\\
And wronged as pious Job—you see I lack\\
The bluntest weapon, have no means nor skill\\
To forge escape from this your noble soldier,\\
Nor even yet to cause him first offence!\\
I beg you grant your royal pardon me,\\
And we shall leave you to your destined task.\\
Our interests are not bronze and steel and blood,\\
But nothing more than unprotesting peace.’\\
But neither look nor argument could turn\\
The lust in Charles to see the lethal fight.\\
‘You’ll take my sword; and aim to do it honour,\\
For it is like a breathing thing, and knows\\
The heart of he who holds it.’ So Charles spoke,\\
And with a hushed and regal air dismounted\\
That he might leave the sword with Cosimo.\\
\\
Now seeing but a single path, or fork\\
Of single prong, and finding no escape,\\
Young Cosimo accepted Charles’s sword.\\
It was a harbinger of certain death\\
To him, and so he breathed as though his last.\\
‘Put up your swords,’ said Charles, ‘and on my word,\\
There’ll be no intermediary here\\
To stand between your strikes and where they land;\\
The loser’s he who lies upon the ground,\\
With neither shame nor breathing left to use;\\
The victor he who stands upon the chest\\
Of his opponent, bowing gracefully\\
To me and all our gathering. So now,\\
If it but please you both, let’s have the fight!’\\
\\
The fighters both put up their swords, and Charles,\\
His stomach hungry for a bloody sight,\\
Nodded his head, and so the fight began.\\
Each second swipe invited Death himself;\\
But Death in patience passive stood, to let\\
The eager mob run low in breath and blood.\\
It looked like Cosimo would fall aground\\
And so the singer, who till now was mute,\\
Released a cry, and prayed that Death refrain;\\
And Death did seem to heed, for then Alceste\\
Began to fall—but rolled to flee the sword.\\
In such a way the fight went on, and so\\
Each man appeared in turn to face his end,\\
Alceste believing he should fend it off,\\
But Cosimo quite certain he should die—\\
That is until the Frenchman saw the singer,\\
Who, seeing that her prayers were in vain,\\
Did shed a single tear, which touched the ground\\
And dissipated there; looking down,\\
He saw the bloodied sword of Cosimo:\\
For it had pierced his heart. Thus he collapsed.\\
\\
The soldiers all were shocked, but Charles alone\\
Did briefly smile (perhaps to see their look).\\
He clapped alone, but soon was joined by more:\\
They saw in Cosimo’s untrained fighting wits\\
Perfection of their selves. With his arms\\
Aloft, Charles called upon them all to fight,\\
Like this Italian, though death might come,\\
As if to chase it back. And now he turned\\
To Cosimo to say: ‘distinguished friend,\\
I cannot but commend you on your win;\\
I see that you were deeply wronged, but now,\\
Receiving honour from this sword of mine,\\
That wrong was righted thrice. Apart from my sword,\\
From me you shall receive a gloried prize,\\
A prize that by respectful men is envied—\\
You shall become an honorary soldier\\
With us, on this our holy blessed mission.’\\
Now Cosimo was given no reply,\\
Was hoisted up by rowdy cheering soldiers,\\
And his bemused companions watching on\\
Were told to strum with them their melodies,\\
For it is in the time of dark and gloried\\
Battle that music is most deeply lacked.
