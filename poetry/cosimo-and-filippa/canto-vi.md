# Canto VI
As Italy slept, but four remained awake.\\
The eye of the meridian did close\\
And only the two extricated lovers,\\
And both the suitors scorned, had open eyes.\\
Niccolò went up to Filippa’s room\\
And, finding emptiness within, did strike\\
The wall so hard as blood would freely run.\\
He roused his private army from their sleeps,\\
And commandeered them take their spears, prepare;\\
‘The night is early and the moon is low,\\
I mean to take some vengeance lest my wits\\
Should cool,’ he said, and thence proceeded out,\\
Abetted by a vast concomitation,\\
A group one hundred-wide or more, each armed\\
As though a private army to himself.\\
The average Florentine would have preferred\\
Infested dreams to all this clanking march.\\
Each woman, child, and man in turn awoke,\\
And some in their pyjamas ran outside\\
To curse the cursed makers of this noise.\\
It was but half an hour before they’d quit\\
The bounds of Florence in an aimless search.\\
Effect and cause are chained inseparate,\\
And superstitious men might find a join\\
Between the thunderous thought of Niccolò\\
And heaven’s clanking, lashing peals of lightning.\\
It is not subject for our speculation:\\
Suffice to say his men considered it,\\
And thus in fear increased their stamping pace.\\
When they had reached the fields, it was as though\\
Entire oceans once condensed, by drops\\
Infinitely were falling to engulf them;\\
And thus did Niccolò speak: ‘the one escaped\\
Cannot be very far. It’s woman’s nature\\
To find a mortal terror in a storm,\\
To think some anger brews with aim to strike them,\\
And thence to find bare refuge in some hut.\\
Therefore we all shall split into a hundred,\\
And each part search its own direction out.\\
It will be Filippa’s luck to live the night\\
Uncaught.’ With perfect order they conferred,\\
And in a second of the moon’s revolt\\
Had synchronised themselves for the search.\\
There was a hill which over Florence looked\\
(Though at this time and in this state nothing\\
Was visible) which Niccolò ascended.\\
Then, sitting down, he brooded on the view,\\
Perhaps intuiting a vision, or\\
Seeking out his target with his eyes;\\
His mind now pregnant but with damning thoughts\\
Of love and lust, and all that category\\
Of things that he termed base and trickery,\\
Except that soon he reached a resolution\\
With dying note: ‘but love is, like all things,\\
A mortal game, with victories and defeats,\\
And if the field of battle can be entered\\
Expecting death, and with such expectation\\
Produce a greater chance of victory,\\
Why then I should go suicidally,\\
For thus it is we transcend love.’
