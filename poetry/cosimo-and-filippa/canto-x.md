# Canto X
Quite often by a twisted path does truth\\
Reach readied ears. This crookedness gives cause\\
To doubt; so we dissect it to the entrails:\\
Thus Niccolò, who heard there was a girl,\\
With soldier Florentine accompanied,\\
That only days ago a forest entered.\\
This truth he placed before his reason’s blade,\\
Subjecting it to thrusts of questioning,\\
And nearly bringing it to death; but then\\
He gambled it was real and set about\\
To swoop upon the woods. Before he could,\\
A scrambling messenger appeared to him\\
And said: ‘my noble lord, the gran maestro\\
Requests your current presence. There are fears\\
From our intelligence that Charles of France\\
Has entered into northern Lombardy\\
Advancing so to take some Valois claim.\\
Piero says we need a thorough caution\\
And all the fighting men we can afford.’\\
On hearing this, and thinking on it deep,\\
The jealous suitor said: ‘you’ll have my men.\\
But as for me, I’ve reasons here to stay\\
Much greater than the sum of Florentines.\\
Go tell the man I have intelligence\\
That Frenchmen haunt this land, that I may know\\
Their place and battle plans, and that with time,\\
I’ll light invasion with deception out.\\
You have a strange look pinned upon your face.\\
I say again I will not be reduced\\
To lackey-work; my mission here is greater.\\
Return and then relate what I have said.’\\
The hurried messenger, dissatisfied,\\
But nothing knowing what to say, deferred,\\
And took his horse’s reins and galloped off.\\
‘I need to mask myself,’ said Niccolò,\\
‘In garment, speech and act; I need to think\\
As though some peasant fool or blameless cherub,\\
Whom nobody’d suspect of murky play,\\
To fly the dove and think the vulture’s thoughts,\\
And by such indirection find a way\\
To trick my Filippa to follow me.’
