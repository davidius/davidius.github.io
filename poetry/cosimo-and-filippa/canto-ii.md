# Canto II

Meantime there was a suitor hidden there,\\
Whose eyes inside the thickness of the dark\\
Were fully gone, and banished from the seen.\\
His presence there was as a vile irruption\\
Into a blessed state. He long had waited—\\
For many weeks he patient stood and waited\\
That he might steal this moment opportune,\\
And thought with spinning Fates he was conjoined.\\
The lovers both, of feuding families’ children,\\
Each from the other cleaved on pain of death,\\
So that they might avoid a roving eye\\
Alighted on a secret scheme of contact.\\
Alas, in pay of Filippa’s meddling father,\\
The suitor cunningly decrypted it:\\
They’d finally arranged to meet and end\\
The dreadful separation, and so to leave\\
Their prison Florentine; the fateful letter\\
With fast and eager eye the suitor read.\\
Once Cosimo thus Filippa forewarned:\\
‘Let us not do as the Babylonians did\\
And by the bloody-to-be mulberry tree\\
Confer in sweat, but let’s meet by a fount\\
To symbolise the newness of our love\\
And all its nourishment.’ Yet even though\\
With knowledge of the tragic end of Thisbe\\
And of her lover much too rash, they did\\
Avoid a repetition of that fate,\\
Still they were ignorant of Niccolò,\\
The shadowed spy who coiled in wait of ambush.\\
He meant as though for private delectation\\
To split the pair, for looking on such things\\
And thinking as it were through gritted teeth,\\
He labelled them abomination, all things\\
Which had imbibed the pleasant breeze of seasons,\\
And which had breathed love’s deep and magic sighs—\\
‘Such things,’ he said, ‘are horrid falsehoods, as\\
A mask of Venice, smiling without brains.\\
And what illusions do they smile at? Figs!\\
I could as well before them hang a cherry\\
If idle dotage was my aim; I doubt\\
That they’d have wit to tell the two apart.’\\
Thus did the suitor spy the lovers twined,\\
And though one was the object of his love,\\
Yet bitterly he cursed them both the same.\\
His sword at side, and backed by a dozen men,\\
He sought to set a parting river between\\
The secret lovers both, and end them hence.\\
Still listening, he stayed his sword awhile.\\
A kiss, a solemn word of true devotion,\\
A longing sigh, a promise hard to keep:\\
Each one of these the suitor saw, and each\\
Went deep into the heart that he had scorned.\\
He had been once a military man,\\
And at Otranto fought against the Turks:\\
He knew that in a siege-torn battlement\\
The good commanders take the fight outside.\\
So lest his fortress crumble under fire\\
He did resolve to show his sword and self.\\
‘Be still!’ said Niccolò, ‘and with a slow,\\
Considered movement step away and back.\\
I know you know of treachery, but I\\
Could not till now pay credit to the thought\\
That you would see it out! I am ashamed—\\
For both your families’ sakes I am ashamed—\\
That blocks no duty though. Do not protest:\\
You cannot claim you know not what I say,\\
For I have read your secret letters, seen\\
Stinking treachery’s sweat in every line,\\
And my position swears to your arrest.’\\
Now Filippa pronounced her first defence:\\
‘I don’t know who you are, but there must be\\
Some dreadful mishap, blunder, fault, or blow\\
Upon the common course of equity.\\
My Cosimo’s not guilty of aught at all,\\
Unless it be the sin of sinlessness.\\
Is there no court where we might plead our case?\\
Or reasonable judge? O please, at least\\
Have courtesy to bring my father here,\\
For in this town he has authority.’\\
The suitor, though, was deaf to protestations,\\
And words, despite their truth, had no effect.\\
With just a finger-click a circle formed,\\
The single suitor followed by the dozen,\\
And stole the only hope of an escape.\\
\\
On Earth for every thousand men and women\\
With virtuous and straight moralities,\\
There is a single one or two, that dwell\\
In the darker, rare-delved regions of the soul,\\
That’s plucked as from another sort of womb.\\
The suitor Niccolò was of this party,\\
And nothing of his empty face or motives\\
Revealed to other men a feeling true.\\
It was this lack that made the pair foresee\\
Their fate as cast as brazen sculptures are.\\
Now then the two were brought apart—the force\\
Could not be halted, was primordial,\\
Was as the boundless gap between the stars,\\
Or as the song eternal sung by choirs\\
In service of Beelzebub. And now\\
The verdict was pronounced: it was to be,\\
For Cosimo, a banishment for life;\\
For Filippa imprisonment.
