# Canto I
Oft said it is that in the glow of moon,\\
In blazing night, when crickets restless sing\\
(And all of nature eavesdrops to the sound),\\
When humid air from oriental lands\\
Reigns over like an omnipresent king,\\
And we’re like captives exiled from our sleeps—\\
That on such fertile earth will love be sown.\\
In such a time and state will lovers rise\\
To follow airy scents they know not where,\\
To sniff the flowers drooping over walls,\\
To write upon the tablets of their minds\\
Melodious sonnets never apt enough\\
For capturing the rhythms of their hearts—\\
And yet such bitter taste amalgamate\\
With sweet, to look upon the night and lack,\\
To sigh the air, to think upon a kiss:\\
That is the poison hidden in the tail.\\
One such was Filippa, who left her house\\
In deepest night, to glide through sleepy streets,\\
Uncaring of the dimness of the light\\
And howls of Hecate’s dogs (a distant sound):\\
These both and more were merely elements\\
The world had stirred to charm and not to note;\\
For by a fount, in similar affection,\\
There stood the very object of her weakness.\\
The man was Cosimo, of whom was said\\
That in his eyes and fingers tales were told\\
Of all the pain in every dreadful minute\\
He suffered in the absence of his love.\\
But if that were indeed the sacred truth,\\
Then just as true is how the tales were changed\\
Whenever his eyes were fixed upon his love.\\
And thus he thanked the heavens and their stars:\\
For Filippa was there, and seemed to him\\
Embodiment of summer air itself.\\
His tongue was briefly locked, and had at once\\
Ten thousand words upon the precipice—\\
It was a brewing storm from which no sense\\
Could soon be plucked, but Filippa’s finger now,\\
With restful calm, alighted on his lip\\
And halted this advance; he breathed, and said,\\
‘My love, these anxious weeks of absence last\\
Might have but for your visage in my mind,\\
Far brighter than the moon embracing night,\\
Been bleakest and most dreadful Scythia,\\
Where Famine, Fear, and Trembling all reside.\\
But like a potion you’ve revived me! Your smiles\\
And subtle looks to me are medicines\\
That only He, the universal physician,\\
Has potency and power to dispense;\\
Or yet like dancing notes on joyous flute\\
That haply from the twisty forest out,\\
Out to the gleaming happy light do lead.’\\
Now Filippa became yet more aware\\
That they were in the midst of silent dark,\\
So Cosimo: ‘what is this gloom to which\\
Your eyes descend? What Hades do they dive?\\
I have a rose here, freshly plucked, which has\\
A charmed aroma, and if you but imbibe\\
And close your eyes, your soul will lift again.’\\
‘That will not do, my Cosimo, I fear.\\
I thought just now I heard the howls of wolves,\\
Which set my mind to think upon my father;\\
Perhaps he now approaches with a troop\\
To have us captured, jailed, and whipped for shame?’\\
‘The issuings of animals have no\\
Significance,’ said Cosimo, ‘I read\\
That with the cockerel’s crow and morn’s sweet herald,\\
The truth goes naked then for all to know,\\
And yet I lied one time and still the crow\\
Had failed to light me out. And if it is\\
That now your father comes with villains towed,\\
I fully armoured am with courage of love,\\
Equipped with means to beat that Maleagant\\
Who’d steal you to the moon that he’d prevent\\
Your happiness ordained.’ He took her hand\\
And saw that it was shaking, kneeled down, said,\\
‘O pale and trembling hand, unrosed with fear!\\
Allow this kiss to be a permanent pledge\\
Of ever-living love—’ and while he kissed,\\
Suspicious sounds distracted Filippa,\\
Which Cosimo dismissed as owls, but still\\
She looked with fearful eyes into the dark,\\
And still with doubt beheld those things that moved.
