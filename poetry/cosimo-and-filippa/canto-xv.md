# Canto XV
The generals made their needless battle plans;\\
The purpled, darkening sky commanded them\\
To sleep. Inside the French camp Filippa,\\
Too addled by her melancholy thoughts,\\
Could not obey. Ghost-like she left her tent,\\
Without intention to escape, unless\\
By thought she could escape in her own mind.\\
This French battalion, stationed over Florence,\\
Had strictest orders to remain until\\
Negotiations were complete with Piero.\\
These men were wrapped in watchless dreamy sleep,\\
Quite ignorant of Filippa’s forays.\\
‘I’ll never leave incarceration now,’\\
She said, ‘whenever I might leave for good,\\
I find a new entrapment there, from which\\
Escape affords not freedom, only jail.’\\
Now looking down at Florence with a fire\\
Unusual, and distant sounds of violence,\\
A lonely glow emitting in the black,\\
All hope was muted out, her home no home.\\
She looked away and walked among the trees,\\
And passed the soldiered tents as though a wind\\
The air had lacked. Her whispers too like zephyrs\\
Had floated through, or so it seemed, the camp:\\
For on the other end was Cosimo,\\
Who like his love had little mind to sleep.\\
\\
The two of them could not be recognised\\
By any eye at all who knew them well:\\
For but for Filippa’s eyes she looked a man;\\
And Cosimo in his soldier’s gear, and beard\\
Extended long, was scarcely Cosimo.\\
The both in ignorance did walk the camp,\\
Through humid air, unknowing where to go,\\
When soon there was a crossing of the paths.\\
Now Cosimo saw this was no man of war\\
But rather a monk of some distracted prayer;\\
‘Respected sir, I see you walk alone,’\\
He said in French, ‘so with your thoughts I’ll leave you.’\\
Embarrassment then scurried him away,\\
But Filippa marked in him a difference strange,\\
And thus in lowered voice asked Cosimo\\
To hold, for maybe in their splitting ways\\
There was some part of common air.\\
On this suggestion paused our Cosimo,\\
Unable or unwilling now to leave.\\
Now Filippa: ‘to quell our thoughts we each\\
Might listen to the other’s tales of woe.’\\
But Cosimo darkened here, and said, ‘my tale’s\\
Too much of woe to tell another soul;\\
In merely thinking of relating it,\\
I seem to drown my heart in tears again.’\\
‘Maybe,’ Filippa said, ‘it will subside;\\
For my advice is shown elixirous\\
To the gravest ailments life can curse us with.’\\
‘Though I don’t doubt you, sir,’ he then replied,\\
‘There are some ailments which cannot be cured,\\
Although with medicine we stuff them full.’\\
\\
But heavied Cosimo drew in the air\\
With slowest pace, as it might give him strength:\\
‘My origins are far from here, along\\
The Arno river distantly away,\\
In Florence, home and cradle of my youth.\\
My childish days and troubled adolescence,\\
Beneath the spires and hills and shaded trees—\\
The smell of which I now can smell again—\\
They all were spent in ignorance until\\
Beside the river I had found my love.\\
But then what brevity! Like Tantalus,\\
I saw her cruelly placed before my eyes\\
Then rudely snatched away. A jealous force\\
Does rule against such states and intervenes\\
Before the natural time. An alien man,\\
Whom till that day I had not seen nor heard of,\\
Came marching with a great mysterious troop,\\
And when he made his motives clear I drew\\
My sword (for though I am a man of love\\
I’m conscious of their use) and as for life\\
I pointed to his very throat and said\\
‘I’ll kill’; to which the man regressed in fear,\\
With terrored look I’d never till then seen.\\
But he was sheltered by his force of hundreds\\
And each of those was sheltered by the others;\\
My threats were consequently scorned to dust.\\
They then advanced and took my love away—\\
Such deeds bring deeds that men might soon regret,\\
But I’ve no shame to say I killed some men.\\
For love there is no stooping we won’t do—\\
Though sir, I see you are a man of God,\\
Perhaps, perhaps in books you’ve read it done.’\\
Now Filippa, in voice persistent low,\\
Replied, ‘I know some more than you might guess;\\
But please, continue with your woeful tale.’\\
So Cosimo continued, sighing deep:\\
‘I soon was overwhelmed and overpowered,\\
For God puts in us infinite desires\\
But gives us finite strength. I then was exiled.\\
Tracing a solemn route from home, from country,\\
And from my love, was ineluctable\\
As pre-determined movement of the spheres.\\
I only spoke my love unto my love,\\
And left her there, unknowing of her fate.\\
What then occurred is greyed in memory,\\
But all those days and weeks afforded little\\
Beside the thought of her. Why, even when\\
A frenzied Frenchman from the undergrowth\\
Emerged with sharpened sword and bent on murder,\\
The dispatch of a life to hell was swift\\
And without thought, for all my thought was hers.\\
And even when the king of France, afraid,\\
Did bow in awe before me—even then\\
I thought of nothing in the world but her.\\
I was enlisted in his army then,\\
To prove against my own compatriots\\
The valour that the French did hold in me:\\
And so you see why I must restless walk,\\
And haunt this camp in darkest deep of night.’\\
Now Filippa by the moon’s illumination,\\
And by beholding such an inversed mirror,\\
Espied most deep engraved in Cosimo’s eyes\\
The whites familiar, and like a lake\\
Unrippling with the calm, saw clearer still\\
The much-distorted visage of her love.\\
She did not still undon her godly robes,\\
For fear, perhaps, the shock might swiftly kill,\\
But only said: ‘alas, I know too well\\
The fearsome plagues and locust-leagues of love,\\
For I had been beset by them in youth.\\
I hale from France, the northern fingertip,\\
Wherein there was a girl whose very look\\
Inside my deepest caverns deeply mined.\\
Reciprocally we professed our loves\\
Eternal as the heavens’ holy beams,\\
And in a secret church engaged to marry.\\
O sweetly blessed was I in ignorance!\\
For soon the fact of our engagement spread\\
To reach our parents’ ears, and as the sky\\
In halves is set asunder by a crack\\
Of lightning, so the two of us were split.\\
O how I contemplated the event\\
In weeks of endless length! O how I worked\\
Contriving finely calculated ways\\
And myriad labyrinthine cunning plots\\
To reunite the heaven’s spheres and join\\
Our shattered loves again in blessed union!\\
But O how finally I was reminded:\\
We must embrace, make friends with love’s illusion.\\
I turned a monk, as now you see me dressed.\\
I monkishly abstained from thoughts of love,\\
At matins turned my soul to other plains,\\
At lauds and prime, through the wretched day,\\
Through dreaded vespers, grudged compline, forgot\\
My heart’s direction, went awry in prayer.\\
But God at last obliged to speak to me—\\
If it was not an idle product of\\
My addled mind—and whispered that our pains\\
Are universal messages, and that,\\
If only we should heed them, Harmony\\
Might still be plucked from Discord’s instrument.\\
The memory of my love sustaining me,\\
I set to write a treatise then on love,\\
Evaporating all my truth and pain,\\
Their vapours thus to bless the common climate.’\\
At this point, Filippa’s voice exasperated,\\
She paused to look down at the city light.\\
\\
‘And was it ever done?’ asked Cosimo,\\
‘This heaven-ordained book, might it be read?’\\
‘If like some demon you might master time,\\
Recovering all the fragments from the flames.’\\
‘I might have been co-author,’ Cosimo said,\\
‘Occasion too fed me profundities,\\
Though far too weighty for my weakened hands.’\\
‘Which revelation was the best of all?’\\
‘The one from which they all did spring, the truth\\
That love’s a mockery, and we a show.\\
For science gives no truer theorem:\\
We’re made to seek love out, but not to find,\\
And if at last to find, we’re not to keep.’\\
Thus Filippa responded: ‘so you know\\
That never will you see your love again?’\\
‘Unless,’ said Cosimo, ‘my soul’s eye\\
Were physical as these, I never shall.’\\
Now Filippa pointed to their whole surroundings:\\
‘Though French I am, I know this land a little,\\
For I beheld it many times in art.\\
Indeed I think my soul once travelled here\\
And mapped it well. Why, sir, these trees and hills,\\
They’re not unlike the comfort of the Arno—\\
At least as I have seen it in the paintings—\\
Look at the fire-lit city down below:\\
Have you no memory?’ So Cosimo did,\\
In fashion quite bemused, look at the hills,\\
But recognising none, looked at the city,\\
His net in seas of memory yielding nothing;\\
And yet he persevered on seeing the road\\
Beneath his feet, which stretching down did seem\\
A piercing route into his very core.\\
He fell now to his knees, and kissed the ground,\\
And said: ‘O Florence, Florence, dearest Florence!\\
I thought you’d stand a vestige in my mind,\\
Yet now you stand more glorious! I’d thought\\
With loss of faith in love comes loss of love;\\
But O, what devious cursèd trickery!\\
Do you not see? This is the final trick.\\
The gods again are quite malevolent,\\
And light a path which ends in fiery flame!\\
I shall go in to find her gone, or dead,\\
Or worse than that, if such a thing could be.’\\
\\
They both had heard some sounds; it was a soldier\\
Who like them could not sleep. ‘What is it, friend,\\
That troubles you?’ said low-voiced Filippa,\\
To which the man: ‘I thought I’d heard the bush,\\
Unnaturally possessing its own will,\\
With devious mind a-rustle tent to tent;\\
And so to cure my new-contracted madness\\
My tent I left alone and sought the sound.\\
There was a moment when I caught the glare\\
Of eyes of hidden man, but then I blinked,\\
And found that he was gone. My comrades, please,\\
If I am mad, please diagnose me thus,\\
Prescribe me herbs, or anything, to fend\\
This tricksy daze away.’ Now Filippa,\\
Who quite alone suspected that she knew\\
The cause of this alarm, began to fear\\
And said: ‘I doubt you’re mad; there is a rat\\
Come here to bring disease. Let’s ring the bells\\
And shout ‘intruder, ho!’ and thus by fear\\
We’ll light him out.’ The soldier, hearing this,\\
Imagined how the higher-ups would whip him\\
On finding he’d imagined everything,\\
Replied, ‘alarms would only squeeze the wits\\
Of all our comrades, rendering them unready\\
For brutal fighting with the Florentines.\\
We all of us are men; let’s draw our swords.’\\
The lovers both agreed, and raised their weapons—\\
And now the three of them stepped deep into\\
The gulf of night, and shivered with the thought\\
That they might die.
