# Canto III

A peaceful distant stream there was, that sat\\
At quiet distance from the Arno river,\\
From which it took a generous proportion\\
Of blessed Apennine water. By its side\\
There sat three fishermen, enveloped deep\\
In their profession. Each of these good men,\\
Despite their fruitful work, philosophised,\\
While, waking from a dream, the sun arose,\\
His blazing chariot apt to pierce the world.\\
Meantime a single dove on morning’s rays\\
Glided with ease, its solitary path\\
Against the rosy sky with gold was framed,\\
The watching fishermen reflecting it\\
Upon their irises of opened eyes.\\
And now the solitude came to its end,\\
And flocks arose outside the gilded edge\\
As though in hearing of the lone one’s call.\\
There followed then a general reunion,\\
And no more could the single dove be seen.\\
‘Look out at the birds,’ the first one said,\\
‘Reflect on the resemblance each one bears\\
To mindless, fleeting particles of dust.\\
Although there’s not a grain of thought, there is,\\
I think, some wisdom there; do you not see?’\\
In truth he had confounded them with words\\
That killed their thought: ‘How can it be,’ they asked,\\
‘That things bereft of brains in the extreme\\
Might live to be so wise? The bird and fish\\
Are more alike than we to either are,\\
And fish fall hourly for common traps\\
Which even foolish men for them can lay.’\\
The first was not astounded in his thought,\\
And answered thusly: ‘have you ever seen\\
A bird behave so foolishly as we—\\
That is to say, the truest fools of us?’\\
‘We’ve seen much worse; we’ve seen them do such things\\
That children of our kind would never do.’\\
‘Such follies deep are in their basest natures,\\
And not their wills, such as in us there’s love\\
And guilt and jealousy, or as you list;\\
Respecting their true selves, they never stray.’\\
It seemed to both his interlocutors\\
That he was either fully-gone insane\\
Or broaching truths mysterious and strange—\\
Though in a drunken way. ‘Alas, alas,’\\
He thought aloud, and saw he could not win\\
With truthful words to the unwilling ear.\\
Now some commotion they did hear, around\\
Some hidden bend of stream; the very sound\\
Invited hushed attention, and whispered words\\
Of mystery to light some doubt in them:\\
And now they were unsettled. ‘Who do you think’,\\
They thought, ‘goes there? It is a daily fact\\
That we attend this place in solitude—\\
A law as yet unbreached by time or place,\\
Attested to by th’rising sun herself.\\
To enter in our realm with such a sound—\\
Is deeply strange, and high-fantastical.’\\
The expeditionary force now stopped;\\
Our fishermen, beguiled, now analysed\\
The troop with close precision, studying,\\
Though ever failing yet to understand.\\
A group of marching men, some eight in all,\\
Had entered in upon their tranquil scene—\\
Though still some dreamy distance far away—\\
Blowing trumpets quite unnatural,\\
As though to wake the souls in deep repose.\\
The eight or nine of them came gliding close\\
Upon reluctant horses clanking chains;\\
The fishermen observed them closer now:\\
‘All their sum is totalled nine, and one\\
Is prisoner to all the other eight.\\
Never have we seen such an array:\\
So terrible, so striding like a peacock.’\\
The nine came by, full cloaked in solemn grandeur,\\
Observing in their turn the fishermen.\\
The man in chains was solemner than most,\\
Looking at the silent soil below,\\
And hardly caring to look up at the earth.\\
This man was Cosimo, who once had sinned\\
By being but in love. He now did speak:\\
‘Such is the world. It sets before us bliss,\\
And has us think we know the truth entire,\\
Then shepherds it away and only leaves\\
Abyss.’ Indeed the gods could scarce deny\\
How true were all the words he spoke. Alas!\\
Two different men of natures quite opposed,\\
Each set by Cupid’s bow towards one aim,\\
The loveless one by sword and violence catching\\
His tainted prize, the other losing love,\\
Becoming then an exiled destitute. \\
How like a floating ghost he did pass by,\\
And how he haunted all observers mute,\\
And how the Arno tributary stopped\\
Its tides to heed the silence from his soul.\\
The nine riders blackly seemed to mark\\
Some other thing than exile’s lonely passage,\\
Commencing here and ending merely there,\\
But sketched out in their figure a procession\\
Commemorating the ending of an age\\
And heralding a new and darker one.
