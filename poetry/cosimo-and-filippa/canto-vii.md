# Canto VII
Beneath the looming Alpine border, where\\
Beyond the Romans thought barbarian,\\
Stood Cosimo, ensheathed in summer dust.\\
The surface of the earth, on which the light\\
And shadow twined did dance aminuet,\\
The breeze, which lofted up small particles\\
Into a swirl of infinite migration,\\
The fleeting glints of sun in blind things,\\
This all arranged as some great consonance\\
Which even Cosimo’s state could hardly doubt.\\
The eight that guarded him did bring him to\\
The pass that’s named the Little Saint Bernard,\\
Where it is thought that Hannibal, along\\
With foolish men and elephants bemused,\\
Once crossed as though it was their Rubicon.\\
They on their silent horses sheltered him\\
Until the very point of no return;\\
Then stood, as to his exile Cosimo\\
Was left alone, unaided and unwatched.\\
He was allowed to keep the starving horse,\\
But pity made him guide it by his side,\\
To spare of pain the skinny, wretched thing,\\
And both were in an hour near collapse. \\
Around two hundred fathoms’ elevation\\
Was reached by then, and by a sheer cliff-face\\
He sat, and peered back down at Italy.\\
Alone there grew a lily breathing air\\
As though the Earth was all its private garden.\\
He thought to leave it there, but saw his horse\\
Descend to sniff with curiosity\\
And then with hunger sigh. So Cosimo\\
Took carelessly his fingers to the flower,\\
And plucked it from the ground half-consciously.\\
The horse’s curiosity increased\\
As Cosimo took it to its hungry mouth;\\
The horse then snatched it whole, considering\\
Its taste with all the methods of an expert,\\
Concluding that he disapproved of it,\\
And finally he spat it out to fall\\
With jilted glide into the folds of Earth.\\
‘Ah Filippa,’ he said, ‘when shall I see\\
Your like again? When will Aeolus’ wind,\\
So blind in its excursions, waft you here?\\
When will this emptied nest be filled again?\\
When will I kiss your hand or curl your hair?\\
Oh love, the penance I would do for you!\\
My sins I’d wash away in all the seas,\\
Or yet traverse them all to sin again—\\
But for to see some visage of your eyes,\\
Not shimmering, but true as life itself,\\
But true enough to haunt some motivation\\
In my forgetful soul.’ He sighed with thought\\
And briefly saw a cloud with winking eye;\\
The horse gave out a neigh, and Cosimo sighed,\\
A distance up the path a whistler\\
Sung roughly and alone unto himself.\\
He stumbled in the fashion of a drunk,\\
Now whistling, singing, shouting to the world,\\
His beard extending to his toe; he was\\
A haggard, mad old man, so Cosimo thought.\\
He thought he was alone, so sung these words:\\
I travelled to the lonely well\\
Whereat to find some drink,\\
Then saw beneath the rabbit’s hop\\
A tomb where it did sink.\\
This tomb I then did pray at long\\
With fifty thousand verses,\\
With a sigh of my voice and a sign of the cross\\
And all of my heart’s purses.\\
Alas but nothing did for me\\
And so I fell to sing:\\
With mighty railings dead men’s tongues\\
Were given flighty wing.\\
With sudden fright he stopped his aimless song\\
And plucked his beard, for he had seen the horse,\\
And heard its neigh, and seen young Cosimo.\\
‘What’s this I see?’ the whistler asked aloud,\\
‘It cannot be another person, can it?\\
It has been many months since last I saw\\
A woman or a man, except at distance—\\
Forgive me, sir, if here you find me startled.\\
But these roads here are rare for humankind,\\
Unless they be the luckless trespassers\\
Or breakers of the law. I almost thought\\
That I should never speak again except\\
In song, and to the birds! I hope my speech\\
Offends you little, sir, with blunted edge\\
That loudly speaks of years of lost refinement—\\
But in your countenance I something spot\\
That’s jointly shared with me. If I may ask,\\
Would you relate your journey’s tale to here,\\
That we might further understand this place,\\
This purgatory of ours?’
