# Canto XI
Deep in the forest, in search of an escape,\\
Was Filippa, by Silvio surrounded.\\
She still was queasy from his revelation,\\
Propping up her mind with bouts of thought,\\
Believing all and none, and marvelling\\
At star-drawn fate, and total loss of will.\\
The suitor tried advances on her heart,\\
But unlike grace it was without effect;\\
Her heart and words were far from each estranged.\\
One is not conquered if one feels it not;\\
The conqueror is nothing if he takes\\
An unprotesting ghost, so Silvio\\
With all his efforts only wore himself.\\
‘We’ll head as west as we can go,’ he said,\\
‘For there we’ll reach the wide and blessèd sea,\\
We’ll sail to new infinities of freedom,\\
Escape these arbitrary laws, and be\\
Beholden only to our own. If you—\\
O, why take you no part in these large dreams?\\
These tempest thoughts of mine I have alone,\\
And you stand still amid the storm, accepting\\
Not less than everything. But Filippa,\\
You were imprisoned by a law of Florence,\\
And so in Florence you always were imprisoned:\\
And now you’ve loosed yourself from the corrupt,\\
The hateful, the iniquitous, why then\\
Will you not sing a happy ode to freedom?’\\
Now Silvio, dejected, turned away,\\
And sunless tried to find a westward path.\\
In silence Filippa replied, ‘I’ll sing\\
When freedom’s mine, when Cosimo I possess\\
In real and present form, not memory,\\
When in my gaze he sits, and I in his,\\
And we talk glowingly; when my life is mine\\
I’ll sing.’ The two of them were ignorant\\
Of greater motions in the world, of Charles,\\
His claims and his invasion. Their fear was half\\
The weight it might have been, had they but known;\\
And so their shock was double when now they saw\\
A man, phantasmagorically transfixed,\\
With thunderous speed make his visage known.\\
‘Hell’s borders have been breached!’ he shouted out,\\
As if to warn the fireflies and worms,\\
And all that there abided. ‘Leave your homes!\\
Abandon all your works without a tear!’\\
Then Silvio approached this man and asked\\
From whence he hailed, and with what news he came.\\
‘Why, sir, the land from which I come is nothing;\\
For now the French invasion here approaches,\\
And Charles in arms is like a chimera,\\
Befitted with a beast for all occasions.\\
There is no succour—harbour nowhere is—\\
For devil-like he sees us all, and he\\
Has men and means to bring his icy visions\\
To the terrored stage of our enactment.’\\
Considering this news, Silvio\\
Reflected how propitious was his plan,\\
For where’s French jurisdiction on the sea?\\
The rule of state becomes the stateless rule,\\
He thought, where only pirate merchants go.\\
Now Filippa withdrew herself, considered,\\
Conceived a plan, then thusly uttered it:\\
‘Suppose,’ she said, ‘the French should find us here.\\
For certes they would see that we’re of Florence;\\
What brash denials will we have for them?\\
If they have any lust, they’d capture us\\
And profit by us monstrous violently.\\
Let us disguise ourselves in monkish habits.\\
I have a little French; enough, I think,\\
To allay their circumspection, make them stay\\
Their swords and bonds of capture, let us free\\
To seek our destined fortunes on the sea.\\
Your speech before had dumbed me like a lamb;\\
My thought had stupefied, could not cohere\\
Into a thought or word. But now I see:\\
Necessity has brought us crying here;\\
And what is there but that which can’t not be?’\\
With wonderment now Silvio was filled,\\
And thinking this the climax of his efforts,\\
Commended Filippa’s plan and searched her eyes\\
With curiosity, and then he smiled.\\
As though an apparition, the man possessed\\
Had gone, his rustlings barely heard, his face\\
Forgot. Their shadows lay along the ground\\
Almost entwined, though Filippa had thought\\
Of no embrace but with her Cosimo;\\
And then it was they searched for their disguises.
