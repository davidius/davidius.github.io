# Canto XIV
In Florence news had found the citizens\\
Of the impending siege. The gran maestro,\\
Piero de’ Medici, of the town,\\
Quick-paced with fear within the palace walls.\\
For rumours reached his ear of pillaging\\
And other French atrocities, of rape,\\
Of bloody murder of the innocent;\\
And he, still being young, feared for his life.\\
The terror painted on him whitened cheek,\\
And but for memory of great Lorenzo,\\
His father late, he might have fled to fields\\
Of distant, alien lands, abandoned Florence,\\
Have lived a private life. But his advisors\\
Opined that he should speak to Charles of France,\\
And with his best negotiation seek\\
A peace political, that there might be\\
No cause for women in the streets to weep\\
In tragic memory of sons and husbands.\\
And so with long-lined retinues he left\\
To seek out Charles. The city left alone\\
Began of feint suspicion soon to smell,\\
Of Piero de’ Medici questions raised\\
And answers posed. ‘He has abandoned us!’\\
Went the refrain, insistent in its beat;\\
And with its ring did strangle all the other.\\
There was a woman who with calmer voice\\
For ‘patience, patience,’ pleaded to the crowd,\\
‘Lest reason in this day should die a death.’\\
Her cries were left, like distant prey, unheard.\\
Now Niccolò’s men, without their leader, came\\
Into the ancient, new-anarchic city\\
Wherein they found a mob with weapons armed.\\
‘You feather-winded cowards,’ cried this mob,\\
‘You loveless ones, without a thought for us,\\
Your fellow man and good cohabitants,\\
Whom like the Carthaginian Dido you\\
Abandon! Leave in shame! O leave in shame!’\\
They coupled these with other such insults,\\
As well as accusations of high treason\\
To which the men protested innocence:\\
‘We nothing know of any hidden deal—\\
Which makes us sick as you to merely hear—\\
And if we knew, for sure we’d not condone.’\\
In mutual distrust both sides exchanged\\
Such warring words until in time were thrown\\
Tomatoes from the mob, and soon the spell\\
Of violence hung in almost every heart.\\
Now overlooking all this frenzied scene\\
Atop a hill, was one of Charles’ battalions.
