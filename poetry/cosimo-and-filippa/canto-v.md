# Canto V
This sable-silvered figure, which to her seemed\\
A sign of heaven’s fulsome graciousness,\\
But dressed as hairy satyr, perhaps a god,\\
So rare in this our world descending,\\
Was to the eye untricked a simple man.\\
The effort of his will, and of his climb,\\
His hard and sightless climb down tower’s side,\\
His braving of the sentinel, the risk\\
Of his career, was nearly Herculean;\\
And yet that he was mortal, not divine,\\
Was as attestable a fact as that\\
The sands of the Sahara are infinite\\
Or that the sun does always greet us through\\
A pleasant fog of air-condensèd dew.\\
Not only did he suffer mortal pangs,\\
And joys he felt when they were due, this man\\
Did madly love young Filippa. Alone\\
This was the logic of his wild descent.\\
He’d seen her first when he had joined the army\\
Of Niccolò, which burdened was with the task\\
Of intercepting Filippa’s affair.\\
On disparate clues, they’d split in search of her,\\
And he by chance had seen her with a letter,\\
Which, when she thought she was alone, she read,\\
And cried, and read again. He by this sight\\
Was moved, and so forgot his own profession.\\
The second time, he saw her plucking berries\\
While lost, amid a pleasant field of green.\\
There was a kind of music in his mind,\\
Made blissful with a song she seemed to sing.\\
She needed only walk along, or speak\\
A noteless word, or stand as still as statues\\
Cast in chryselephantine by the Greeks,\\
And he would be enchanted from his wits.\\
Alas for him, this sight was young to end\\
As Cosimo came dancing on the scene\\
And all the orchestra abruptly stopped.\\
He’d turned around to pick the berries more\\
And silent sing a tune he had forgot.\\
Since then it was emblazoned on his heart\\
That he would either have the girl or die.\\
So deeply dug was woe beneath the soil,\\
To dig it out would be to top the woe:\\
A fate most cruel and false. So thus he did\\
Embrace his pain, till such a time as he\\
Could find his jewel again beneath the tides.\\
The solemn pleasures of his solitude,\\
With all their clouds in heavy unison,\\
He nursed until the thundering day, at which\\
Was rung the name that could not slip: Filippa.\\
He did not then participate in that\\
Which soon followed, the capture and the exile;\\
But still he knew, and could not let it pass,\\
That Filippa, the one he wept to think on,\\
Was trapped like Danaë by Acrisius\\
Inside a tower, of natural glow divested.\\
The courage he had previously lacked\\
Was found now in the very air and earth\\
He’d priorly ignored. He plucked it out,\\
And no less than an hour was to pass\\
Before he found his Filippa, still charmed\\
With all the magic of the devil’s drink.\\
Before this day he was not seen by Filippa\\
Save in some hidden corner of her eye.\\
And now! such luck he thought he had, when she\\
Saw in his every limb a thing transcending\\
Mortality. And yet it was to prove\\
A curse, for who can shake his soul and self,\\
Becoming with the power of alchemy\\
The image in the eye of fantasy?\\
But knowing nothing of her addled state,\\
He thought him doubly blessed; and so continued\\
The dream remainder of the gifted hour.\\
His luck was now itself a kind of drug,\\
Which, swirling all of Florence in a mix,\\
Began denying him his senses. Such\\
Did he proceed to do (becoming sad\\
With every step): he took her to the church\\
Of Saint Ambrogio, reflecting that\\
There they could sanctify their loves; then to\\
Some private land that sat on city’s edge\\
(The glowing sun now breathing final embers);\\
Then picked a flower which he gave her name,\\
Concluding finally the day was ending.\\
And now he thought: ‘this city and its lands,\\
Nay, even Italy entire, we’ll flee,\\
Since doing deeds by heaven here is sin\\
And men here punish innocents as gods.’\\
He seemed to drop a tear on seeing all\\
Things fall asleep. But Filippa, undrugged,\\
Awaking to the waning world, was caught\\
In panic now, to this satyr changed.\\
But Silvio was too trapped in dreamy wafts\\
To notice Filippa’s change. From one horizon\\
To another, Filippa surveyed the dusky field,\\
And noted with alarm that all redoubts\\
Were too far gone where safety might be found.\\
And now another fearful bell did toll\\
When Silvio, surprised, did notice change.\\
The man was weak as any man, and when\\
He saw the trembling of her frightened limbs,\\
Her desperate study of the situation,\\
He nearly fell in grieving empathy.\\
To see the peerless beauty of before,\\
Who’d only thought of plucking berries sweet,\\
Thus brought before the unjust Nature’s court,\\
Was pain unparalleled in Christendom.\\
Now Filippa, not blind to minor looks,\\
Did comprehend such pangful thoughts in him;\\
And yet the veil of fear was not to lift.\\
In silence Silvio pleaded her to hark,\\
And then thus spoke: ‘Don’t fear me Filippa,\\
For though you’ve never seen my face, I am\\
A man of good intent. I’d heard of you\\
And the arrest conspired, the chaining in\\
The horrifying tower, the accusations—\\
And how they bit at me, oh Filippa—\\
I know, I know, you doubt me still, perhaps\\
You hold me as a charlatan adept\\
At miming innocence, but please believe,\\
This news much pained my heart—and all for what?\\
For crime so guiltless as to be in love!\\
A crime which all of us do perpetrate!\\
For someone of the beauty you possess,\\
By God, I’d think it wicked and most churlish,\\
Even had you killed a living man,\\
To send you to a solitary cell—\\
Unnatural to silence nature so.\\
And so to set aright that thing the state\\
Calls justice (nothing but a mockery),\\
I faced the possibility of death\\
To find you out.’ Now carefully Filippa thought,\\
Beginning soon to see the suitor’s eyes\\
More naturally; she saw that this was not\\
That Niccolò, that man from goodness ripped\\
Who never yet again would thence return;\\
She saw Silvio was not from that stock forged,\\
But still—his origins were just as dark.\\
‘We now are outlaws,’ said Silvio, ‘and who\\
Can tell where we might end? Therefore escape,\\
Escape is all we have, and all that we\\
Might ever hope to have: and so let’s run!\\
Abandon Florence to the men and women\\
Perpetually following the law\\
Of man! Not only Florence, but Italy\\
Entire!’ To which our Filippa, reflecting,\\
Resignedly agreed its sorrowed truth.\\
With coming darkness darker clouds approached\\
And brought slow portents of the coming storm.
