# Canto XII
The sun, descending from our mortal vale,\\
Bestowed us with a final, glowing wink,\\
And left us to our darker ways alone.\\
Disguised was Niccolò, who barely saw\\
His forest home before his eyes adjusted.\\
What alien figure there! Out of Florence,\\
Where he was sheltered well, how different now!\\
His newfound clothes, Venetian rags, could not\\
His constant eyes disguise so well, he thought,\\
Those double agents of the secret state;\\
And yet no man who knew him priorly\\
Could without clue detect him for himself.\\
‘She’ll never see me for the hated man\\
From whom she did escape. To think! To think!\\
A face might move our tired limbs to act,\\
To risk whole generations in a war,\\
Although the eyes might lie with trickery;\\
A face is the cause of Filippa’s preferment\\
And this dismay of mine. Such things we prize\\
And hate, though disconnected from an act.\\
But in her exiled state, possessing hope\\
And green unknowingness, I merely need\\
To act as though releasing her from bondage,\\
And she will follow. That is an easy power,\\
And if I can imagine I can do.\\
But yet these eyes. They’ll not so tamely hide,\\
And I have heard it said by the young and old,\\
That even thicked in darkness we can see\\
The shining entities, lighting truth\\
That should be smothered out. Well now, indeed!\\
That I should find myself in speculation\\
In sapping influence of the bowing masses!\\
I think I still possess a winning power;\\
And I have brains to make there be no cause\\
For her to doubt. The darkness hides my eyes,\\
And I shall aid the darkness with my cover,\\
This saintly act that I by now have mastered.’\\
Thus whispered Niccolò, and on into\\
The yawning dark he paced, success assured\\
Inside his mind. He did not travel far,\\
And soon was lain before him as a banquet\\
The thing for which he searched. It was a clearing\\
From which light seemed to flow, was deeply silent,\\
And which caused Niccolò to stop and breathe.\\
Within this space was Filippa alone.\\
Full nakedly she washed herself with water,\\
While by her side there lay a robe and wig\\
To don to fool the French; and near enough\\
To hear her gentle song was Silvio.\\
But Niccolò knew nothing of this state,\\
He only watched in admiration rapt,\\
Composing similes for all her moves:\\
Each drop of hair was as a rush of gold\\
Or shining river; every blink a fount\\
Of innocence and warmth—in such a vein\\
He went, until he soon exasperated,\\
For what he saw was of the ideal realm\\
Where words are mute. He sat to rest, and she,\\
Betraying nothing, thought she heard a sound.\\
But when she turned around there was an absence.\\
She now was dressed, convincingly a man,\\
And very soon, before she might away,\\
Niccolò, her suitor dark, approached,\\
Unrecognised. ‘My gentle friend,’ he said,\\
With tone of lamb with human voice, ‘I am\\
A man of Venice, as you see, who saw\\
You now alone. A shiver in my heart\\
I had. I would not be a man of honour\\
To leave you here unsaved. The French army\\
Is a mighty and a many-headed beast:\\
With charm alone you will not live, therefore\\
Allow me to escort you to a safe-house\\
Wherein the foe, cunning though he is,\\
Cannot approach.’ But Filippa suspected,\\
In Niccolò’s hidden eyes, the foulest thoughts.\\
He greeted her just on the transformation:\\
Too quick to have missed her in her nakedness.\\
The thought occurred that he may know her name\\
And who she is—that he was cloaked like her.\\
And so she said: ‘your offer is most kind,\\
And if it weren’t that I had other duties\\
I would be honoured to accede, kind sir.’\\
To which said Niccolò, ‘I do not mean\\
To halt you in your duties, comrade, but\\
These men are killers of a vicious sort;\\
There is not prey enough for them to hunt.\\
Attending to your duties at this time,\\
You do yourself a grave disservice. Please—’\\
At which word Niccolò was interrupted,\\
For Silvio returned awaked with fear.\\
He’d seen a garrison of bloodied Frenchmen\\
Inebriated at some victory,\\
Too drunk to care that he was naked, changing\\
Into his newfound guise. ‘We must away,’\\
He said, ‘the devilish French approach us fast\\
And will not spare the innocent!’ He stopped\\
On seeing Niccolò, whose sharpened look\\
Caused fear to well. Now Filippa sought to stall\\
Before the soldiers came, that she might still\\
Escape. ‘This man,’ she said to Silvio,\\
From Venice hails. He says it’s in his power\\
To shield me from the armies of the French,\\
And I believe. And though I tell him I\\
Can live alone, he still insists I follow.’\\
But Silvio thus replied: ‘It must not be;\\
It is like swimming to a different isle\\
Before the waters rise: it just delays\\
A destined death. Let’s to the roaring sea\\
Wherein our safety permanently is.’\\
In such a vein the trinity went on,\\
The two men giving reasons opposite,\\
And Filippa still trying to delay—\\
In which she found success, for soon was heard\\
A clamour ominous: the whirling French.\\
They came in a set of six, each highly armed\\
But with a drunken sway. The leader pulled\\
His sword from out its sheath, and with an eye\\
Preparing for a fight, said drunkenly\\
(While Niccolò decamped behind a tree):\\
‘What treasonous conspiracy is this?\\
What dark, clandestine gathering is here?\\
For never when I met with friends in forests\\
Was ever the outcome good. Confess yourselves!’\\
These words he said in French, and Filippa\\
Alone could understand. ‘Please, sir,’ she said,\\
‘We mean no grain of harm. Our meeting here\\
Is presageless and light coincidence,\\
And I for one lack capability\\
To think conspiring thoughts and act on them.’\\
To which the Frenchman said, ‘why, sir, your French\\
Is lovely as a dove which glides from tongue\\
To air—you surely must be native French?’\\
‘I, sir,’ she said, ‘am native of no place,\\
And have been French as much as Florentine.’\\
‘Good, good!’ the Frenchman then replied, surprised,\\
‘Our king, who is a gloried man of the world,\\
Will love to know of you, from where you spring,\\
And what you know of our Italian foe.’\\
The set of six surrounded Filippa;\\
One took her feeble hand and thought it strange,\\
Unmanly for a man who wandered much;\\
But still he let it be, attributing\\
This strangeness to the blood of Florentines.\\
Now Silvio and Niccolò looked on\\
In helpless agitation, each in turn\\
Attempting to protest—to no avail.\\
The Frenchmen only heard incessant noise,\\
And being six they could outshout the two.\\
There was no painless remedy but patience\\
For Filippa’s suitors both, which with disdain\\
They did administer. Both thought of plans,\\
Tremendous plans, outlandish feats of skill,\\
Which they’d pursue regardless of the Fates.\\
To follow silently the soldiers’ path\\
Was Silvio’s plotted course: there’d be a time,\\
He thought, when great Leviathan sleeps and snores,\\
And he return his love. But Niccolò\\
Contrariwisely thought to go to Florence,\\
In guise to save the city from the French,\\
Wherefrom he’d leave to reconnoitre them\\
And fetch our Filippa from their columned ranks.\\
Except that each in deep suspicion held\\
The other man, and sought to form an image\\
Of blacker purposes and darker aims.\\
‘Sir, who are you?’ said Silvio, with fear;\\
And Niccolò emerged from shadow’s shelter\\
With new-unhidden sword, and like a tiger\\
With instinct ancient sniffed the naked terror.\\
‘From Venice I am, or Florence or Milan,\\
For all that it concerns a man like you,\\
Who never in my view has stepped till now,\\
And thinks the information of the world\\
His natural right,’ said Niccolò, to which\\
Silvio then replied apologies\\
And bowed in supplication. Niccolò,\\
Suspecting that he recognised the face,\\
And that he understood this complot failed,\\
His sword in accusation raised, so that\\
The sweat of Silvio began to drop,\\
His face adopting now familiar form\\
To Niccolò, who now did grasp it all.\\
The following episode we should avoid,\\
And rather not detail the strange delight\\
Or terrifying zeal in Niccolò’s face\\
On recognising Silvio disguised,\\
And on reflection on the empty forest\\
And new-inaugurated lawlessness.\\
It will suffice to say that Silvio’s hopes\\
Were quickly ended then and transferred whole\\
To Niccolò.
