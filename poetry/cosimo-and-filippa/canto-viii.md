# Canto VIII
‘It is a tale I rather would not tell,\\
For promises were made and left unkept,\\
And tears were shed—and will be shed again—\\
And such things form a sorrowed recollection.’\\
So Cosimo replied, to which the man\\
Held out his hand, entreated him to follow,\\
For no one knew these lands as well as he.\\
Now every path to Cosimo was equal,\\
And death was life, and life was death, without\\
His Filippa. Therefore he gave assent,\\
Proceeding thence to wander through each day\\
And through each night, without a stop except\\
To find the barest, briefest hour’s sleep.\\
‘If you should hold, with near-fanatic gloom,\\
Your story silent locked, and weather it\\
With little healthy air,’ the whistler said,\\
‘Perhaps you’ll bear the telling of my tale,\\
Which stands up like a stony testament\\
And true avouch of who I am?’ To this,\\
A plea of pain and plainest honesty,\\
Assent was given, and thus did he begin:\\
‘When that I was a shepherd boy, and young,\\
I took my respite from my shepherding\\
On high Carpathian hills, by sitting over\\
The rolling views below. I then would take\\
My flute from out my pocket, play a tune,\\
And therewith sing my tiredness asleep.\\
My friend, you may know something of this fact,\\
But still there is no curse in repetition:\\
Some beings out from unknown air themselves\\
Do pluck, and tempt us with their other world,\\
And have us follow, singing nonsense-words\\
As if admixed with high exalted sense.\\
Upon my playing, such-a-one once came,\\
A blond-haired girl with lilies decorated,\\
And said—if you’d believe—she’d never heard\\
A tune so right, so mellow-sweet, and yet\\
Replete with nature’s stark solemnity.\\
Upon these words she smiled and disappeared\\
Back to her labour. Only for that tune\\
She later would return, and every time\\
She did she closer came, and gave a sense\\
She had some fact of great import to tell. \\
Then once—alas, the final once—she said,\\
“It is a pity, tragic pity even,\\
These notes must wither all to obsolescence,\\
And even every one to nothingness,\\
For lacking marble permanence.” She left,\\
A final time she left, but I knew not,\\
And I had stood prepared to kiss her lips\\
And write a melody for her to sing\\
To harmonise my flute. From then I said,\\
“I’ll name that girl Zephira, for she had come\\
From westward worlds, and was intangible\\
As wind.” My life is very different now:\\
I never shall by fairies haunted be,\\
For I have chose these exiled passages\\
For home, and cannot shiver but recall\\
My origins. And thus it is with me.’\\
Now Cosimo, with face of feigned engrossment,\\
Invented sympathy, dismissive phrase,\\
And left the old man to his memories.\\
\\
One night the whistler sung a restless tune,\\
But Cosimo wanted sleep, could not abide\\
These goatish hymns and serenades, so grabbed\\
His scruff of neck, and pleaded ardently\\
For him to quit his hellish, tiresome song.\\
The whistler stopped on seeing Cosimo’s eyes,\\
Then said, ‘there was a song inside my soul,\\
Was caught between translucent panes of glass;\\
It needed only freeing.’ Cosimo,\\
With whitened cheek, relented, fell asleep.\\
\\
The night had moved but two or three degrees,\\
The water-bearer still with cup in hand,\\
The half-immortal Dioskouroi still\\
With cattle of the Milky Way behind them,\\
All that sleeps did sleep, and all that moves\\
Did barely move at all—except a tune,\\
With wondrous harmony floating up above,\\
Upon the surface shimmering, the ear\\
Of Cosimo softly brushing—so he awoke.\\
The whistler too awoke, curious\\
What fragile heart had shattered for this song.\\
Obscurity still reigned, and Cosimo\\
With faulty eyes attempted to depose\\
It from the earth. But still it was the lord\\
Of his imagination, still it ruled\\
As though a shepherd watching over flock.\\
And Cosimo called aloud, and asked the dark\\
Such that his voice did echo, ‘what are you?\\
And why is it you sing in the deep of night,\\
When no one but yourselves should hear a note?’\\
They ceased their tune, and in the Alps there echoed\\
A hollow silence, sounding in the bone.\\
And now appeared as through night’s opened curtains\\
A band of five, four of them possessing\\
A lyre, a tambourine, a flute, and harp,\\
The other bearing nothing but her voice.\\
‘And who are you,’ this singer then returned,\\
‘That blasphemously breaks our solemn song?\\
I didn’t know such interrupters dwelt\\
Along our Alpine pass for sacraments\\
Reserved; and if I’d known, I would not sing.\\
Come, men. Let’s sing our sacrifice elsewhere.’\\
Now Cosimo, quite mystified, replied:\\
‘The two of us, and this our starving horse,\\
Are exiled souls, possessing no abode,\\
Except the world, the sempiternal host\\
To all of us—though yet it seems to me\\
That at this time it is no home at all.’\\
The woman, smiling, understood of exile\\
From all her days of it, and thought aloud:\\
‘That is a thing for song,’ and said no more.\\
Then Cosimo, reflecting on his love\\
And of the song he curiously cut,\\
Spoke thus: ‘You played a song which I did stop,\\
And now I wish my dreams had been infected,\\
My very soul with wondrous strains of pitch\\
Freed to the higher airs. Therefore I plead,\\
For me, begin where you had ended last.’\\
‘Alas,’ said she, ‘the moment now is past:\\
The sun I see begins his escalation,\\
And with his flame lights mystery away.’\\
To which young Cosimo: ‘the sun and moon\\
Are twins of one celestial mother born,\\
Their auras, light or dark, are both the same.\\
Your song possesses some escapist balm,\\
For which I say I have particular need;\\
For short of drinking from the Lethe river,\\
There is no drowsy haze I’d rather drown in.’\\
Then she replied: ‘don’t ask the birds to chirp,\\
Nor tell the crickets when to sing their calls;\\
For nature is no servile animal\\
And will not bend at slightest whim of wind.’\\
Thus Cosimo returned: ‘if you’ll not sing,\\
Perhaps you will regale us with your tale?\\
For I should like to know why five musicians\\
Walk in the pass of Little Saint Bernard;\\
I’d thought before today my exile was\\
As single as the rarest ruby stone.’\\
‘It rather is as common as the dust;\\
And even kings and queens in castles share it,’\\
The singer said in quelling of this thought.\\
As though receding to a lonely fog,\\
Beneath which minds are all invisible,\\
She moved back drunkenly. Then with an air\\
Of absence catching in her voice, she said:\\
‘Those things on which our songs must speak for us\\
We must be quiet on, and never speak.\\
And yet those things which kill by repetition\\
Cannot by us be sung; unless we’re gods,\\
The act of song itself will kill a truth\\
And thereby make a falsehood.’ Cosimo\\
Thought this a very strange philosophy,\\
And said, ‘I should not think that song alone\\
Is murderous, or that a passing speech\\
Were like a bloodied dagger poised; why then,\\
Each fleeting day I’d cause a dozen deaths,\\
Yet never with such crimes would I be charged.’\\
The singer only looked away, and said,\\
‘We travelling lyrists, poets, bards, and singers\\
Have found no rented home, nor pay no tax,\\
Yet there are dreadful crimes we may commit\\
And face no execution but the hangman\\
That is the mystic conscience. That were worse:\\
In arbitrary things there is some lightness,\\
That yet we might forget—though that is past.\\
Now tell me, sir, what do you know of love?’\\
His eyes absorbed deeply in hers, he said:\\
‘I know too much, yet like a grain of sand\\
Against the rolling waters of the world,\\
I am but small.’ The very question posed\\
Aroused in Cosimo a fascination,\\
So now he ventured: ‘Might I gently beg,\\
Although I know I know you not, and though\\
It contravenes your stated attitude,\\
Yet as a child regarding the cavern dark,\\
You’ve given me some curiosity—\\
I mean to say, would you relate your tale?\\
For who here in our lost and exiled world\\
Is in a rush? And if you do, well then,\\
I’ll tell you mine as well, and that might give\\
Some source from which to harp a plaintive song.\\
Of that you music-makers always need.’\\
\\
The singer, seeing that he would not leave\\
Without this tale, relented. ‘I was in love,’\\
Began her tentative reply—a pause\\
Did follow then, a pause of icy substance,\\
As an awaking from a hibernation\\
Unto an arctic zone, or otherwise\\
As a descent into the lifeless cavern\\
Where dwells the fiend—‘I was in deepest love,\\
But as a Turk my love was darkly framed:\\
The man was an Italian, a man\\
Whom blood and bringing up had destined me\\
To curse as infidel, and yet a man\\
The tender part of me could not but love.\\
During the time of war, we had been split:\\
I on the Turkish coast, and he remaining\\
In Italy, against the dread advance\\
Of Ottomans. Still in this time we spoke\\
By slow and pained epistles over seas,\\
And by his written voice I heard his soul\\
That I might know he truly was alive.\\
Yet still there was a shaking fear in me,\\
And it persisted to a perspiration\\
When I had not received his word in weeks.\\
Oh, but to think on it! The manner still\\
Is mystery: I doubt if life could bear\\
The daunting marks of detail to the nose.\\
Their echo is enough, for he is dead,\\
Dispatched by those allied to him, upon\\
Discovering our secret correspondence,\\
And that is what I know.’ And now she stopped\\
Abrupt, as though the yellow leaves along\\
Her solitary path prevented her,\\
So Cosimo said, ‘I need not hear it all\\
If pain will choke your tongue.’ But she looked up\\
And thus went on: ‘I went to Italy—\\
For then his early death I hadn’t known—\\
And found the city of Otranto, which\\
By Turkish force most bloodily was taken\\
And then by the Italian regained.\\
Investigation took me to a man\\
Who knew him well, who would not but for pleading,\\
For direst pleading, tell me of his fate,\\
And knowing it I had no land to tend to;\\
All lands and none were mine. I might have left\\
And sailed for Turkey then, but for a gypsy\\
Who with surpassing knowledge frightened me.\\
She said she knew of my Italian lover\\
And of a secret method to contact him.\\
My curiosity rose above my doubt,\\
And she held out her hand for recompense,\\
Which duly did I pay, and thus she said:\\
“You must climb to Otranto’s castle, and there\\
You’ll find an emptied shell, a purgatory\\
Where every soul whose body here has died\\
Lives out a suffering before ascent\\
To heavenly spheres or drop to fiery hell.\\
There if the soul so wills, your deepest prayers\\
May come to fruit: your lover then may speak,\\
And you may end his purgatorial pain.”\\
Still doubting her, I entered then the castle,\\
And there was told that I must do a penance\\
If I should be admitted to the chamber\\
Where all the dead reside. I did not know,\\
Nor could have guessed, the superseeing duke,\\
The castle’s resident, to be a villain\\
Who’d planned for vengeance on the Ottomans.\\
So there he sought to gather us, the way\\
Our soldiers gathered the Italians,\\
And then to kill us in a brutal manner.\\
Now for some dark unnatural delight,\\
This duke, then deep in alcoholic sway,\\
Required of us that we sing to him\\
(We Turks that were thus duped into this ploy),\\
But as it were to those that we had lost.\\
So each in turn we all performed our pains,\\
And when I sung my song I saw his eyes,\\
And noted then a change from veilèd hate\\
To softened sympathy—imagining,\\
As I believe he did, that I did sing\\
Direct into his soul—and as though troubled,\\
He left us in the hall where we were meant\\
To sleep. Now there were sentries at the gate,\\
And none of us could leave unless to die—\\
But there were more of us and less of them,\\
And trapped we must behave as creatures trapped,\\
On which conclusion five of us agreed:\\
To kill the duke at night, and kill his guards\\
Should they protest. We sheltered were by night\\
In fear and high rebellion, forging swords\\
Of little use in war, but for the job\\
Were adequate indeed. In the witching time\\
We shattered our imaginary chains,\\
And flew each to our designated target.\\
Mine was the duke himself, who nearly screamed\\
On seeing me, but that I hinted well,\\
With all my charm, that I might yield to him.\\
In consequence of my perfume, with dazed\\
And quite regardless gait he came to me,\\
Expectant of a kiss and true conversion,\\
And when I felt his breath he pursed his lips\\
And closed his eyes, while I withdrew my sword\\
And stabbed him in the gut. You’d think it strange\\
But I heard sounds rise from the womb of night\\
With harshest whisper of my loneliness,\\
That said such things as deeply would disquiet,\\
As like, “Rubadah is accursed, and all\\
Her days remaining will be of regret,”\\
And other things that horror to recall.\\
With tremulous heart I shut my ears to them.\\
My new friends having done their bloody tasks,\\
We left the castle stained, unfound by eye,\\
By ear unheard, and found the city’s port,\\
From which by candle of the dawn we sailed.\\
So now pursued by law and memory,\\
We fled the jurisdiction finding this,\\
These Alps, this purgatory of wounded love,\\
In which we haunt away our woe with song\\
And live as shadows in our afterlives.’\\
\\
Now Cosimo, moved by this tale, replied:\\
‘We two are of a kind, and all your band,\\
And this my friend, for we have shifted through\\
The daisy sighs of love, attendant woes,\\
And yet we still are full with skin and blood\\
To singly sing new woes. It is, I think,\\
A consolation. But is there a place\\
That now you go?’ ‘We are to France, where now,\\
It’s said, the king is playing the drums of war\\
And hopes to steal Italian land upon\\
A minor claim. His land might prove to us\\
A blessed sanctuary.’ ‘I’ll follow you,’\\
Said Cosimo, perceiving then great work\\
He might fulfil if he could tail this army,\\
Or take up arms in it and free his land\\
From foul corruption’s stench, might melt the chains\\
That bound his Filippa down. ‘I’ll follow you,’\\
He said again, but with a new resolve,\\
While comprehending the variety\\
Of roads ahead, that exile forced to choose,\\
But yet concluding unity of end.
