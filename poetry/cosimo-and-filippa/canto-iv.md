# Canto IV
Strange dreams are frequent visitors to those\\
In chains and prisons darkly trapped—and shaped\\
With edges sharp and bent, so as to cut\\
The last defensive flesh of weaker spirits.\\
Such fleet imaginings are made for night.\\
They’re reckoned shaped for such a time because\\
The day affords us rays of sun, and sun\\
Is overlord of all that grows on earth;\\
And bloom suggests some possibility\\
Of last escape. There is a tower in Florence,\\
(The very image of the one in Pisa\\
Where poets tell that Ugolino died\\
Along with mighty hunger and his children)\\
In which young Filippa was locked. She knew—\\
How could she not!—that strange dreams would arrive\\
If eyelids drooped beyond a certain point:\\
Thus all the muscle of her body strained\\
And every part of all her will was turned\\
To keeping full awake. It happened that\\
These efforts were obscured; for though the dreams\\
Had little greater will than she, the man\\
Now entered in her cell, the very same\\
Who set her present sentence, caged the mind\\
And body indeterminate, and ceased\\
The course of nature from its destined end.\\
Now Niccolò was to the top adorned\\
In gold and red, in finery that showed\\
A veteranship of many horrid wars.\\
His smile was brief, and in the very muscle\\
There seemed a battle staged; now all remembrance\\
Of station and of passions underserved\\
Did sally forth from top the high-ground hill,\\
And sought to beat the showy temperance back.\\
But temperance at last did win the day,\\
And Filippa observed a heartless smile,\\
Which he proceeded to suppress, and give\\
Performance of his solemn earnestness.\\
He then did utter words of truest love\\
And made comparisons with wide arrays\\
Or whole diasporas of separate things:\\
The library of Alexandria;\\
The ancient scribes of Babylonia;\\
The fertile land upon Gangetic plains\\
Where roam the rhino and the gharial,\\
And where the Asiatic Lion sleeps;\\
The elements of Euclid and the soul’s\\
Migration in the Pythagorean view;\\
Of all these things and more he spoke at length,\\
And seemed to bring the universe entire\\
Into his straying speech. The mixture formed\\
Was of such difficult complexity\\
That only those of highest intellect\\
Could vaguely see the sketch he pencilled out.\\
But for our tale it only needs be known\\
He thought all lofty words inadequate\\
To form a merest semblance of his love.\\
Yet still, despite all wordy protestation,\\
The fear in Filippa did not withdraw,\\
So Niccolò thus spoke: ‘I understand\\
You still retain some feeling for that man;\\
But don’t the poets liken love to war?\\
There is a great seducing romance in\\
Great victories; the quelling of the foe\\
Does bring a universal exaltation—\\
Which yet I see you do not greatly bask in.\\
And yet it surely is legitimate\\
That I should win your love by present means\\
As by a peaceful other, is it not? \\
If you might disapprove of he who’s loved\\
By one whose judgement is not forged as yours,\\
Why then you might concede you judge at fault\\
If arguments before this court are brought?’\\
Now Niccolò had mixed a crafty brew\\
To use in case his wordy efforts failed.\\
The recipe was Eleusinian:\\
Kykeon in the main, but generous\\
Was he with fungus of ergot. He smiled\\
To think that he, like Circe long ago,\\
Was to seduce without a honeyed word—\\
Which to the strong of will was raindrops only—\\
But with the honey of the bees, and with\\
Those things most whisperèdly held down deep\\
In nature’s vault. The brew he gave as though\\
An offer most sincere; indeed he sipped\\
Himself, to prove the lack of poison there.\\
He whistled then a tune, and rose, and left,\\
The drink remaining to be drunk at will.\\
With eyes suspicious Filippa now looked\\
At the glass that stood alone, that in its silence\\
Did beckon her to drink. She reasoned that\\
The potion was her only sustenance\\
And that if only taken at a sip\\
It surely could not kill. A hesitance\\
Descended now as from the evening air\\
And wrapped its trembling body round her heart,\\
While fortitude, a snake, inveigled itself\\
In this embrace, and made terrific knots—\\
And soon the hesitance, still audible,\\
Was barely heard. So then did Filippa\\
Raise up the doubtful chalice to her lips\\
And drink a single drop—to no effect:\\
The strange concurrence of ingredients\\
Was all that she observed. And so again\\
She sipped, and still again to no effect.\\
In such a way she drank the chalice whole\\
And found—strange wonder!—no effect at all.\\
In seven minutes, though—a time in which\\
She wondered at the motives of this act,\\
In which, as from her stomach, questions rose\\
And threateningly tasked her constitution—\\
The magic of the fluid worked and worked,\\
And bred a strange and deep capacity\\
For visions seeming realer than the real.\\
The cell to her was changed into a cloud\\
On which her Cosimo, as though a lamb,\\
Stood fawningly. Around him were perhaps\\
A thousand roses strewn, each singly plucked\\
With individual care. Now Cosimo,\\
With surfeit great of love, took one by one\\
The roses up and offered them to her,\\
And Filippa said, ‘please stop! There is too much\\
Of roses here.’ For all their monstrous number,\\
She could not move, and so her pliant lover\\
Obliged in this request, began to cry,\\
Was inconsolable in grief, except\\
For softly lettered words into his ear,\\
At which he smiled. She was in some respect\\
Aware of her beguiled, disarmed condition\\
And yet was quite unpractised to defeat it,\\
So she continued in her vision-role\\
And said, ‘there are too many roses here\\
And we must out from them before we die.’\\
‘But only love a flower: it will wilt,’\\
Said Cosimo, which baffled Filippa.\\
Interpretations filled the rosy air,\\
From which she tried to call the truest one.\\
‘But love a flower—that is very strange.’\\
Perhaps—and now she caught it out—perhaps\\
A flower is a lover, tender thing,\\
That might be broken by a straying hand?\\
Therefore some fawning lover she should find\\
Which she should love to wilt. For such a one,\\
A helpless figure, she’d wait a lonely hour,\\
Her only friends the visions of the drug.\\
This figure, when it came, was in her eyes\\
A Pan-like being, or a satyr, mixed\\
With limbs of goat and man—a vision, still,\\
For Niccolò’s poison barely lost its power\\
Though Cosimo now was gone. It was a man\\
In Niccolò’s employ named Silvio\\
Who had gone up to bring her sustenance.\\
‘Who might you be, O piping forest-creature?’\\
She said, believing that he held a pipe,\\
‘Might you have come to play a melody\\
And wrench a sweetness from a bitter fruit?\\
Or will you charm me with a witty dance\\
That men have for a hundred generations\\
For the begetting of new generations\\
Most gaily used?’ To which this Silvio\\
Reacted with surprise, and said, ‘why, no:\\
I come with these comestibles for you\\
To eat.’ But such was Filippa’s tangled state\\
She heard no human words; but only sounds\\
Of gentle and suppliant animals.\\
All Silvio’s words were thus interpreted,\\
And though he thought he spoke for clarity,\\
Yet nothing of it could be understood—\\
Except that from the broth was picked a herb\\
That smelt of love, so that all sounds resounded\\
With similar note: and so she did conclude\\
This goated man the flower prophesied.\\
Despite her state confused, this insight was\\
Far truer than perhaps she might have known\\
Had not her mind been cruelly thus afflicted. \\
‘But only love a flower,’ her Cosimo\\
Had said, so then despite herself she held\\
What to her seemed the paw of Silvio,\\
And saw in him love’s new alertness woken.\\
She said, ‘this stuffed confinement beats the joy,\\
The natural joy that two might rightly share,\\
Out from my lungs. I feel the air so light,\\
So delicate and gently-calling-me,\\
That to ignore it is a deadly sin,\\
Much lower down than gluttony or lust—\\
Ah, to embrace it is a memory,\\
This tower and the evils of the world\\
Will see to that.’ But yet this Silvio\\
Was moved on hearing all these raining words\\
And, duly weakened, and though it was near-madness,\\
He then resolved to free our Filippa.\\
Into the evening sky he looked, and feared,\\
Considering the situation’s weight\\
With all the reasoning in his domain.\\
Now he produced a key, which Filippa\\
Beheld with wonder, though a terrored symbol\\
Of promised end to him it did remain. \\
And yet despite this fear, this nervous leash,\\
This thing called cowardice by some, or reason, \\
He placed the silver key in the window’s lock\\
And turned it like a whirling wind, unlocked\\
The gate to unknown freedoms. Now Filippa,\\
Her hand of separate mind, did take his hand,\\
And thence diminuendo’d down the tower\\
Onto the welcomed ground.
