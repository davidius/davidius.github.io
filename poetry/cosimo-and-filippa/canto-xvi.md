# Canto XVI
The cause of all this crazed alarm was he\\
Who not long prior had split the lovers twain.\\
Now like a vengeful spirit he crept the camp\\
Near-silently, but with a reckless anger\\
Inviting curses, pained oblivion\\
Of Hades, hell, and Helheim all at once.\\
His sword he drew, concluding that if he\\
Should lose desired Filippa, he’d kill\\
All human obstacles, including her,\\
To tame the deeply-swelling anger caged.\\
He paused behind a tree, and saw ahead\\
The lovers both, though only Filippa\\
He recognised. They both were out of earshot,\\
And so this whisper Niccolò was deaf to:\\
‘Let’s run to flaming Florence down below\\
Wherein this dark disruptor cannot reach us’—\\
That voice was Filippa’s to Cosimo,\\
To which he did assent unthinkingly.\\
They left the camp—the darkness-visioned soldier\\
Still hunting warily his hidden prize—\\
And fled with quickening pace downhill to Florence.\\
All this the villain Niccolò did see,\\
And now with barest thought of being seen\\
Gave chase invisibly. Now Cosimo,\\
Though in a desperation to escape,\\
His eyes attuning to the night began\\
To recognise the world of finer details,\\
The darker landscape of his inmost soul,\\
The very garden of his memory.\\
He seemed to float in such a recollection,\\
Desirous but to grasp some golden object,\\
An apple from a tree, enfolded rose,\\
Consoling key of continuity.\\
There was no pausing, though, in such a time.\\
In minutes they had reached beloved Florence\\
And passed the marble ghosts of bards and sculptors\\
Who smiled upon their shape, and saw the mobs\\
Descending to the street with flaming torch\\
(Though they did not know why), and every step\\
Inflammatory mix of pain and joy,\\
For Cosimo saw his place. They wended through,\\
Still unaware of Niccolò behind,\\
Till finally they ended at the fountain\\
Where months ago they had been cleft in twain.\\
\\
Now Filippa said: ‘is this the fountain you\\
With such forlornness recently recalled?’\\
‘Indeed this is the place,’ said Cosimo,\\
‘In point to point, in very point to point.\\
I might lay forth a suit of witchcraft, sir,\\
For such omniscience. How is it you,\\
On merest hearing of my tale, should know\\
Its very core as though it was your own?’\\
‘Did I not say that I could prove elixir\\
To love-inflicted ills?’ said Filippa,\\
‘And yet I see you still have little faith,\\
Believing these are still love’s mockeries.\\
But tell me, is there not a part of you\\
That holds the candlelight in search and hope?’\\
‘O none,’ said Cosimo, ‘and all at once!\\
My love is love itself, and if she’s dead,\\
What sanctuary? But if she is alive—\\
Oh curse such foolish thoughts, she’s not alive.’\\
Now Filippa pressed the more: ‘but tell me, sir,\\
Suppose she now appeared, what would you say?’\\
‘I’d tell her to retreat, for I’m aware\\
Of Satan’s apparitions sent to haunt\\
Our sanities away.’ ‘And so there’s nothing\\
Within the bounds of speech to out the truth\\
Of her identity?’ ‘Unless this being,\\
With preternatural gifts, could give her name,\\
Could give the place of our first hallowed meeting,\\
Could list out why I love her and she me—\\
I doubt I could believe.’ ‘And now suppose\\
That I could by some undisclosed means\\
Unveil this figure to your doubting eyes\\
For you to inquisition at your will—\\
If I could beckon her and she could come,\\
Why then you’d have no cause to doubt my art,\\
And sure as Great Bear’s constancy you should\\
Abandon your renunciation of love.’\\
In resignation Cosimo conceded\\
And said: ‘if such impossibility\\
Could travel to our too-prosaic world,\\
If such an act that monks should not conceive,\\
And certainly never do, should now occur,\\
I would indeed renounce, I would renounce.’\\
‘You are no soldier, sir,’ said Filippa,\\
To which the forlorn Cosimo replied:\\
‘Do you insult me now? What frippery\\
Mean you to pluck from such a wounding stab?\\
Do you not see my accoutrements of war?\\
Do you not see my eyes, so steeled with blood?’\\
‘I only mean to say I am no monk\\
Despite the clothes you see and tales I told.\\
You’ll understand it all if but you close\\
Your eyes.’ In this our Cosimo obliged,\\
Not knowing why, and while he could not see,\\
Our Filippa shed her manly wig and robe\\
And said ‘unclose them now and look at me,’\\
Which Cosimo did. So strange to contemplate\\
The agitations of a mind so placed,\\
So questioned at the border of the real.\\
He thought he saw a pale resemblance, or\\
Some resurrection ancient-prophesied,\\
Or further yet some new-descended angel—\\
And questioned whether he himself had died.\\
\\
‘Do you still not believe?’ she asked him then,\\
‘Although I say my name is Filippa,\\
And I can name the Saint Antonio church\\
As that in which we first did meet? And though\\
I might unroll a parchment twelve feet long\\
To fill with reasons of our mutual loves,\\
You still would not believe?’ He stood full mute;\\
And did not doubt, but did not full believe.\\
A million master craftsmen, playing God,\\
Their lives in service of a great commission,\\
Could not approximate her eyes’ expression;\\
But still the devil might—if intellect\\
Alone could understand the weakness and\\
The humour and the love, in such proportions\\
So finely weighed and yet so tethered to\\
A mind so constant that in outward change\\
She would remain. But if the devil could,\\
The devil would no longer be the devil:\\
For if God grants us love and then purloins it,\\
The devil is no more to blame than He\\
Who, though the lie be true, still does deceive.\\
Therefore he took her hand and kissed it soft,\\
And stumblingly prepared to voice his mind,\\
When like a vile resurgence of disease\\
Persistent Niccolò, who till that time\\
Had watched enshadowed this reunion,\\
Ascended from the dark in new disguise,\\
With sword behind his back prepared, did say:\\
‘My reckless Florentines, why hang you here?\\
Do you know nothing of this town’s rebellion?\\
Or that you might be killed on mere suspicion\\
Of close association with Piero?\\
If you have any will for life’s prolonging,\\
I have a safehouse where you might be stowed\\
While our contemporaries, for senseless aims,\\
Might each the other kill, and we might wait.\\
That I might guiltless live, I beg you follow.’\\
\\
Now only Filippa conceived the thought\\
This man was Niccolò; she moved her hand\\
To Cosimo’s, and to his ear she whispered:\\
‘This man is not the saviour, but the cause\\
Of our misfortunes. See his hidden sword.\\
Behold his loveless eyes: to trust him is\\
To bring a final plague upon our lives.’\\
So Cosimo touched the pommel of his sword\\
Received from Charles the Eighth, and grabbed the hilt,\\
And Niccolò, on seeing this, retreated, \\
And innocently asked, ‘what is this show?\\
I come to save, and now am faced with death?’\\
So Cosimo returned: ‘we know your face;\\
To save is not your nature, but to kill\\
And to destroy is all your reasoning.\\
So draw that sword behind your rounded back\\
And fight to claim your undeserving win\\
Or else to cede in all humility.\\
We finally shall end this masked charade.’\\
Now Niccolò insisted on pretence,\\
So said: ‘I draw my sword in ignorance\\
Of all this talk of claims and fights and masks;\\
I only ever from necessity\\
And from compassion natural as milk\\
Did make to save your lives. I shock to hear\\
This accusation. But if you do believe\\
I caused you pain, or that you did to me,\\
What blame amounts, not knowing what I did?\\
Although against good nature’s will this flies,\\
I see I now must die, or be the one\\
To cause another’s death.’ And so they drew,\\
And thus began the fearful steely clashes\\
Of sword and sharpened sword, each poised to strike\\
To pierce the skin, and let out lethal blood.\\
Now Death again descended from his tower\\
To see a tempting scene, and at the thought\\
That all three could be made to die at once,\\
He hungrily did salivate. The air\\
Was growing chillier now, and Filippa,\\
Who couldn’t draw her lover from the fight,\\
Felt this a premonition, and so said:\\
‘Retreat, my love, or else this ends with blood,\\
And this our chapter in the book of life\\
Will finish brief and without epilogue,\\
And never be remembered in the world.\\
And what then will be made of all these months,\\
Which looked to have no end? We should that age\\
Ourselves escape, not blunder to extend;\\
For having each the other within reach,\\
What prize is gained by further separation?’\\
\\
A welling sorrow seemed to fill the hearts\\
Of both the men, and so they stayed their swords.\\
But in the quiet of Cosimo’s distraction,\\
The sword of Niccolò plunged towards him quick;\\
Though yet not quick enough, for Cosimo saw\\
The motion of the thrust and parried it,\\
And in his new-forged anger drove his sword\\
Into what heart remained in Niccolò.\\
The wounded, looking up, fell to his knees,\\
And, lacking strength, could not retain his sword,\\
So weakly then it fell. Now Cosimo\\
Approached his wounded villain as to kill,\\
And Niccolò surveyed the view as though\\
To take a final note. A moment then\\
Of thought and memory passed smilingly\\
On Niccolò’s lip, and he reflected if\\
He’d done this act or that another way\\
Or been another man—‘I mean no violence,’\\
He said, ‘give to this rusty sword no heed\\
Although I pick it up. You both are free,\\
And have no role in what I next shall do.’\\
With dark solemnity did frosty Death\\
Approve this thought, regretting only that\\
He could not lure from them a greater violence.\\
Now both the lovers looked the other way\\
As Niccolò himself did end his life\\
By slitting of the neck. They ran away\\
And said, ‘let’s leave this scene, which not long since\\
Had been our very woes’ inaugurator,\\
And now with bloodied wrath does seem to end them.’\\
\\
They waded through the incensed locals—seeing\\
The men of Niccolò’s army like a body\\
Decapitated, but endeavouring on\\
Naïve—and breathless reached a towering hill.\\
From here was seen the burning ire of Florence,\\
And, farther up, the hill where stood the French.\\
Now Cosimo held his Filippa’s hands, and said,\\
‘I once was in a dazzled spell, a mist\\
Enfolding all of me, and then we split—\\
I tell you, love, the objects of this world\\
Appeared anew as hostile things with teeth\\
Prepared to bite. But I’ll no more on that.\\
For here amid the dark I start to see\\
The older bloom of things in slow return;\\
I think I am not wrong. Come, Filippa.\\
What is it you are thinking? I see some change.’\\
A smile both brief and lovely passed the lips\\
Of Filippa, who noted of his eyes,\\
Considering the import of his words.\\
‘The state is without law, and bids us leave,’\\
She said, and silently they left their city,\\
Still burning ever bright, and tried to give\\
No thought but to those things that bound them both.
