# Canto XIII
For weeks had Cosimo, encumbered by\\
His legs and weary soul, travelled over\\
The towering mountain roads and pastures great\\
And green—but only saw in them reflections\\
Of land within by sorrow weathered through.\\
To him the great Earth seemed to groan, as though\\
In echo of his heart; and so to hear\\
Was in itself a newer kind of woe.\\
He hardly spoke, except it were to hear\\
The sound of thought, which ’spite of being air\\
Was comfort and solidity. Now he,\\
In such a vein, alone began to speak:\\
‘O never in the valleys of the world\\
Or over seas or in the caverns dark\\
Will this my tale be heard. And even in\\
The fatly thronging marketplace, where men\\
By day exchange their goods and conversation,\\
And pass along small woes and joys as though\\
Of consequence, not even in such place\\
Will conscience know of me. But yet I think\\
It is a tale of love, and with such tales\\
The feeling mind is profitably furnished.\\
O not a soul will know: I am outside\\
Such warmly talking worlds. And if I die—\\
And if I die—it need not come to that;\\
I still have life. I still have muscle, mind,\\
I still have will: perhaps I also have\\
The tender smile of fate? I was (and am)\\
An exiled man whose fate was only death;\\
But now by unseen trickery I come\\
Again to greet the green, sweet land of home.\\
There is amid this storm a calm foreseen—’\\
He looked beyond the world’s particulars\\
And grasped ideas invisible and strange,\\
And these were comforting. Imagining\\
Some future scene, the actors swathed in charm,\\
He dreamt a long recital of his tale\\
To entertain the crowds, the high and low,\\
Of how they’d hear such bouts of taunting fate,\\
Such scrapes away from death, courageous shows,\\
And long-forgotten bleaknesses which time\\
Had sugared over well; and there would be\\
Some meaning after all to all his woes. \\
These weeks had been accompanied by music\\
Which straight flew over him; but softened now,\\
Impressed with timeless thought, the drift of notes\\
From voice and instruments possessed his ear.\\
A plaintive song, of earthly depths and harsh,\\
Was softly sung. It spoke, with focused words,\\
Of love and love’s impossibility\\
And extricated with a new-sharp blade\\
Cosimo’s bleeding hope. ‘Our plight is small,’\\
The song reminded him, ‘and is as dust’.\\
With such a tune he shuddered in a new\\
Descent, and his capacities of reason,\\
And hold on time and place, like cowards fled,\\
And to himself he seemed another man.
