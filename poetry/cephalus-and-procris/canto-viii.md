# Canto VIII
And then a sound. He gripped Diana’s spear,\\
Still tainted with the blood of the lately killed,\\
And as a tyrant sweeps his land with agents,\\
He set his questioning eye on shadows, moving\\
With frantic haste to spy some predator—\\
But finding nothing, he breathed some final air\\
And hurled the spear like lightning in the dark.\\
A hush ensued; from which a cry of pain.\\
From this a shudder, then a soft collapse.\\
\\
‘What fell?’ he said, ‘Is there a beast in nature\\
That could pronounce so womanly—a cry?\\
Such isolated cry?’ Again he heard\\
The cry of Procris, and in a subdued sound\\
An undistinguished word: Cephalus.\\
It almost was lost in calls of birds and rustling\\
Of leaves, but there it passed, fully heard\\
Despite ongoing nature, and in a moment\\
Terror was formed, fire-hewn, in Cephalus.\\
He ran in its direction without breath,\\
Imagination coldly painting horror\\
From which his mind averted, until he saw\\
A bloodier horror still: a motionless body,\\
Hair strewn and helpless, the spear removed—he must\\
Have known, but now how the real confronted him—\\
It was his Procris. Breathing still, but barely,\\
Her blood still urged itself along its path\\
Towards the earth, and Cephalus denied\\
That it was so, and fashioned fast a bandage\\
From Procris’ dress, staunching the flow of blood.\\
Then Procris, nearly mute with weakness, and having\\
So large a weight of things to say, but now\\
Helpless to shape their burgeoning chaos, thus spoke:\\
‘Oh, Cephalus, this bandage is a chain:\\
I won’t be free—I can’t be free, until\\
It’s gone. Take it off me. Oh Cephalus,\\
What made you throw the spear? Don’t answer, don’t;\\
Let’s say what needs be said. I love you still—’\\
On saying this the wound stung more acute\\
‘—And think you also love me. Just tell me this,\\
Just make me this last promise, Cephalus—’\\
And here imploringly her sad eyes widened—\\
‘Promise me that you won’t take her to wife,\\
This Aura girl I heard you call, promise.\\
Our love was one time sacred, growing in\\
The shades divine, watched over by the gods,\\
And I would rest upon a bough and hang\\
Upon your words, and you would try to woo me.\\
Beginning so, it cannot end like this,\\
So promise me, I beg.’ Now Cephalus,\\
Near-suffocated by denial, said,\\
‘Believe me, Procris, those words were to the wind!\\
They were apostrophes, exasperations,\\
And nothing more! You must believe me, Procris,\\
All thoughts I ever had were yours alone,\\
They were enslaved always to every look\\
And every glance, those erstwhile tender masters\\
Whose gentle lordship was a bliss, and which\\
To flee would be a prison.But O, our love\\
Is like the boundless seas, and we two islands,\\
Subjected always to the stormy whims.\\
We may yet bridge them, Procris. Believe my words:\\
I’ve learnt too much to hold our diamond love\\
As trash, to place it on the market stalls,\\
To set it thus bemused with common men,\\
And so to throw to some horrendous pyre\\
Where all that’s good is sacrificed—our love,\\
Still burning as the dying sun that once\\
Lit all the glowing world. I’m wiser now.’\\
On these last words the weakness Procris felt\\
Augmented, and her natural resistance\\
Against approach of death became subdued,\\
Stilled by the image of the boundless sea,\\
And all of Cephalus’s protestations\\
Were like those infinite waters, which she let rise\\
And wash her over, and in such way accepted.\\
Although she lacked the power of utterance,\\
She seemed to indicate towards the wound\\
And beg the bandage off; then seeing there\\
Was little use, her hand returned to ground,\\
She closed her eyes, and with the briefest smile,\\
She died. In that moment a leaf was loosed\\
From a high branch, which with a gust of wind\\
Was blown away, but Cephalus saw nothing,\\
Heard nothing: the world of surfaces was now\\
Invisible. He gently shook the corpse\\
Of Procris, which without regard smiled on.\\
Seeing her lain in strange and limp position,\\
Her tender arms made stone in painful angle,\\
Her legs not deigning from the jutting rock\\
To coil away, despite her calm expression\\
Now he could not deny. His breath at once\\
Was quickened, and all about he looked in vain\\
For signs of heaven’s tricks, but all the while\\
His head was shaking in a fevered tremor,\\
For deathly truth would soon rise up triumphant.\\
Meantime in fear he looked at Procris’ face,\\
Not comprehending what he saw, so near,\\
So warm, and yet what visitation from\\
Eternity! What image of the life,\\
So artificed by death, so well perfected,\\
With all the Stoic fortitude compressed. \\
‘What had she to endure!’ he said, ‘what blows!\\
And what avoidable blows!’ While still alone\\
He’d thought to pluck a flower, and thus entomb\\
Her suffering with a symbol, but, seeing her,\\
That thought was futile now. Eyes closed, he spoke:\\
‘You Fates! You never-ceasing weavers, spinning\\
Solutions in the tongue of mystery!\\
Will nothing block your path, nor army halt\\
Your onward march? Or will not pleading do\\
In stifling your murderous zeal? Is there\\
No key that opens up your hearts to us?\\
For you are distant in the infinite sky,\\
And we to you are dust that swirls in order\\
And settles in a shape that pleases you.\\
If I could breach the deep-fixed border between\\
The earthly and divine, Prometheus-like\\
Invade and steal the vaunted power of\\
Revival, if I could bid the muted stones\\
To breathe, return the borrowed life from the rose\\
New-plucked—O for a day to have such power!—\\
With mortal flesh I’d brave the ire of gods\\
To bring you back. For just a single moment,\\
Encased away by some divine protection,\\
Some brief time, with foreknowledge of its end,\\
Enough to prove to you that you were loved—\\
More truly, Procris, more by far, by far,\\
Than woman ever was—then I myself\\
Could die at ease. O but to see your face\\
In innocence, in the prelapsarian time,\\
To make the shifting memory a thing\\
As palpable as flesh. I’d surely know\\
What I had lost. Ye gods! Is that your plan?\\
To give us wisdom when we need it least?\\
To mock us with the heat but give us not\\
The fire? Our souls will burn, consume themselves,\\
And make the world but ashen plains and flat,\\
If your devices turn without impedance.’—\\
And here with pale and trembling hand he wiped\\
What seemed a tear from Procris’ lifeless eye—\\
‘Through ignorance I’ve fallen to the ranks\\
Of dullest wit, I am the guileless man\\
Who smiles and knows not why, and thus deserves,\\
For all his thoughtless doubts and empty strayings,\\
To have his treasure ripped like traitors’ heads\\
Or babies from dying wombs. But worse! Much worse!\\
To lose my Procris of all.’ With this he kissed her,\\
And with a mighty heave he lifted her body,\\
Her dirtied dress of white now being stained\\
With sickening strokes of red, and without thought\\
Of boar or spear, nor on his destination,\\
With hushed solemnity he walked. The friend\\
Of Procris then, who’d tried with speed to chase,\\
But lost her way, grew of a sudden sick\\
Beholding the horror: ‘murder!’ moved her tongue,\\
And Cephalus began to cry, but spoke\\
No word in his defence, and merely went.
