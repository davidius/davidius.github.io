# Canto VI
A new sun rose and sent its searching rays\\
Above the mountains, through the misted vales,\\
Until they reached the woken Cephalus,\\
Prepared already, zealous for the hunt.\\
He kissed his sleeping Procris’ smiling cheek,\\
At which she stirred and mumbled, then left equipped\\
With Dian’s never-failing spear. The sun\\
Surrounded all in waves of blazing light\\
But nature seemed half-sleeping, as though its eyes\\
Were dazed with sun and did not want to open.\\
This sleep was comforting to Cephalus,\\
And as he ambled with his horse he knew\\
The forest could devise no trick nor fate\\
That could outwit the power in his hands.\\
The morning sun gave off oppressive heat,\\
Conspiring to distract all those who sought\\
Their fortune in the forest’s midst, and indeed\\
Its work had some effect on Cephalus,\\
Stirring in him forgetfulness, almost\\
Allowing prey to pass in innocence;\\
But soon he saw a boar, and in that instant\\
Distractions were forgotten, blood was raised\\
From its complacent slumber, and all the mind\\
And all the muscles sharpened to their task.\\
Imagination is supreme in us\\
And can condemn the highest kingly power\\
Down to inconsequential poverty\\
At merest thought. Forgetting for an instant\\
Diana’s spear, all Cephalus’ advantage\\
Abandoned him, his heart alone to beat\\
Accelerating rhythms, faster than\\
The hooves of the fleeing boar, the would-be feast,\\
Could run away. But just as quick he felt\\
The spear, and nature seemed to crown him with\\
A kind of glory, for now again he peered\\
Over the realm, and found an ease he’d lacked,\\
Smiling to see how easy was his conquest.\\
He saw himself a god with other gods\\
Atop Olympus resting in the shade\\
Of victory, hearing and reciting tales\\
Of mortal struggle, and, happy at this image,\\
He thought to chase the boar a while, for fun,\\
Pretending that he had no godly power,\\
That accident had never thought to lend\\
This salve against itself—but soon he tired\\
Of this triumphant sport, and it was hollow.\\
The heat of sun and sweat began to drench\\
His thought, and with a heave he threw the spear,\\
Which traced its destined path through air and flesh\\
Into the boar’s stilled heart. This being done,\\
Dismounting from his horse he found a stream,\\
And shedding his encumbering clothes he lay.\\
\\
The day was hotter than he’d known; the heat\\
Still raged and choked his brain from peaceful thought,\\
So in a rush of hopehe called for Aura,\\
Nymph of the breeze and Oceanus’ daughter:\\
‘O gentle breeze that rides beneath the sun\\
And circumnavigates, meandering\\
Ephemeral paths, alight here in this forest\\
To cool me down, and having spoken to\\
The other powers, find a way to quell\\
This heat that rises up from Phlegethon—\\
Which is insufferable and chokes me. I beg!\\
If spirits can attend to human cries,\\
Extend your sympathies and save me now!’\\
Indeed the air arrived with wondrous weave\\
Through labyrinths of trees and parching fauna,\\
And as the servant to his master, obeyed.\\
Just then there was a rustle in the bush,\\
But Cephalus, imperiously bathed\\
In pleasant air, thought nothing of the world,\\
And let it wander by on separate business.\\
Therefore he didn’t see the wandering woman,\\
Who saw him naked, fanned by the pliant breeze,\\
And heard him call to Aura. ‘Aura! Aura!’,\\
Again he said with smile oblivious,\\
At which the woman, Procris’ friend since childhood,\\
Suspected some adulterate liaison,\\
So ran away to tell. And still this sound\\
Could hardly end the hunter’s bliss, whose mind\\
Was floated then as of its own accord\\
Back to the time he stood in Dian’s bower.\\
‘This is how gods on Earth expend their days!\\
I have my grove that’s infinite in bounty,\\
A running stream with fair supply of fish,\\
I even have the charm to call the breeze\\
Whenever I have need! If anything\\
Exists I lack, I have forgotten it’,\\
He thought, but soon he felt a heavy pang,\\
Seeing himself and thinking about Procris.
