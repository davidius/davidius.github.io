# Canto II
His hair he dyed from blond to fire-red\\
And gloved his hands, obscuring the wedding-ring;\\
In gleaming gear himself he beautified,\\
Appearing quite unwarlike and urbane.\\
As he approached the marriage house he paused\\
And asked if it were not a better thing\\
To turn around and leave his doubts unquestioned.\\
But no; he treaded on until he reached\\
The village of his home, and there he glanced\\
At all of the familiar things which yet\\
Possessed some taint and hue of difference.\\
This tree was slightly shorn of leaves, this road\\
A little farther worn—and what was this?\\
A villager unrecognised at first,\\
His face possessed of eight years’ extra toil,\\
Of life and loss, and natural existence.\\
Amid such changes in their multitudes,\\
That which he doubted most was most unchanged:\\
Despite the passing of the world, Procris\\
Remained her faithful self. But in his mind\\
Assuredly Aurora’s words hung on,\\
Much like a candle, the extinguishing\\
Of which throws all in darkness. So he went,\\
Impressed with imminence, until he found\\
The home he knew. And there behind a window,\\
In mournful black, her face arrayed with tears,\\
Her grief locked in the eye, her hope withered,\\
Was Procris standing true. This tender sight\\
Laid claim upon the heart of Cephalus,\\
And he was almost moved to shed his guise\\
When suddenly Aurora’s words returned.\\
So then he knocked, and caught a fleeting look\\
Of Procris wiping tears, and in a moment\\
The door was set ajar. ‘I don’t receive,’\\
She said, not being seen, ‘I have no mind\\
For business or for friendly company.’\\
The door then moved to close, but Cephalus\\
With quick foot stopped its path. ‘But lady, please,\\
I only mean to speak to you,’ he said,\\
‘I’ve heard from many people of your grief,\\
And all of them have cried to speak of it.\\
Myself I think I understand, as I\\
Have likewise laboured through such torpid time.\\
To know of you I doubly cry: for you,\\
And for my recollection, ever-present.’\\
Doubt hung, but Procris’ manners won it over:\\
She eased away and let the stranger in.\\
\\
As on that distant morning, each outward sign\\
Remained the same, suspended in a realm\\
Of ice that stood outside the watch of time.\\
It seemed to Cephalus the window’s flowers,\\
The lilies and anemones, stood still\\
To guard this world, and that there was a spider\\
That weaved the same web in the very place\\
That he had left it. On the dusty table\\
Still there remained the note that he had left,\\
And still there were the fruit bowls (without fruit),\\
And still there was the hanging line of clothes—\\
But now the dusky sun encased it all\\
And passed its flickering beam with different light.\\
On seeing this and Procris’ eyes dejected,\\
The task began to trip his soul; he shuddered\\
In mortal pause, and for a moment skewed,\\
In some coincidence of alien light,\\
He saw himself without and distantly.\\
He might have stopped, had he not slipped again\\
To hear Aurora’s bitter words. His eye\\
Was darkened, and his inward parts made cold.\\
This Procris saw, and, eyes downturned, she asked\\
‘What did you want to say? Just now you said\\
You only meant to speak.’ Her husband then:\\
‘There are’—and now he smiled—‘I mean to say,\\
I too have known the soul’s confinement towered\\
Above the world; I too have looked with a sigh\\
Upon the aimless wandering of the wind;\\
Myself I’ve been the captured mountain bear\\
Without the heart to break its bonds. But know\\
These bonds to be your own: you are yourself\\
The prisoner and the gaoler, and have the key\\
That frees you. Love!—Or possibility\\
Of love—awakes the bitter darkened eye\\
And banishes the stifling dust, with its\\
Imperium it hushes petty woes,\\
And paints weariness itself as tiresome.\\
And for this unsought charm what does it ask?\\
No weary work nor heavy rock of burden;\\
But that your disposition crossed and cold\\
Be thawed and opened to its entrance.’ But Procris\\
Beheld him then with doubt. ‘My heart is built\\
On one foundation,’ she said, ‘and so to give\\
My love away as though at market stalls,\\
Both cheaply sought and cheaply sold, would be\\
Engenderment of ruin. If love has deigned\\
To build this desolation, it cannot soon\\
Be made to tear her down.’ Her husband nodded\\
Solemn, and uttered words of understanding;\\
But still his hand, not seen by her or him,\\
As though by some invisible will, moved\\
And landed on the soft and lonely hand\\
Of Procris, which then loosened from this grip,\\
Its mistress reeling back. ‘Don’t touch my hand,’\\
She said, ‘or with sly motion make approach\\
Of posed affection. I am a porcupine\\
Or shell; your medicine only causes pain.’\\
Profusely Cephalus apologised,\\
Imploring her forgiveness (though doubting still\\
Her power of resistance to his charms),\\
And in her innocence she soon relented.\\
‘Tell me the name,’ he said, ‘of he who left\\
Those many years ago, not to return.’\\
That glass was misted over, and for eight years\\
She viewed it distant and oblique, refraining\\
From giving names to parts. Sighing, she said,\\
‘His name was Cephalus, a daily hunter\\
In Attic woods, which sweating task he thrilled at\\
More than the sun to rule or than the Earth\\
To bear such rule.’ ‘And how,’ said Cephalus,\\
‘Was Cephalus built?’ ‘Tall and muscular,\\
Befitting of the hunt,’ then, seeing the stranger,\\
She almost said, ‘like you’, but stopped herself\\
For fear of damning hope. Now Cephalus:\\
‘What colour were his eyes?’ ‘His eyes,’ said Procris,\\
Who now was looking at the stranger’s eyes\\
In thoughtless daze, ‘his eyes were watery blue.’\\
‘Like mine?’ said Cephalus with a passing smile,\\
But Procris looked away affrontedly\\
And asked herself, who is this man who mocks\\
And claims the place of comfort? Other men\\
Had come before and brought with them appeasements,\\
But all were thanked outside the barring door\\
And scarcely seen again; not one of them\\
Made offerings of affection or rude compare.\\
But this one enters righteous, asking questions\\
And touching hands, and pleading the case of love\\
As though his own defendant and invention.\\
She looked exasperated out the window\\
And thought again of Cephalus, and when\\
He would return, unfreeze her life to life.\\
‘I think I saw your husband once, on horse,\\
At any rate a man of your description.\\
It must have been some seven years ago,\\
Amid the nearby forest. Just a glimpse—\\
He’d seen a hog and started his pursuit—\\
But strange, so strange, I thought, how near alike\\
He was to me, excepting certain details.\\
Does it not seem that way?’ He drifted close\\
While saying this, with Procris snared in image,\\
Not seeing his approach and stirring now\\
The bounds between real life and its reflection,\\
Believing that the stranger and her husband\\
Were one and indivergent, accepted then\\
The stranger’s proffered kiss, but only for\\
A moment. Strange coincidence of thought!\\
Rare brew of deep transportive elements!\\
Such wonders of the mind at times descend,\\
When such an eye is paired with such a smile,\\
And in a certain ray of light, despite\\
Our doubting we have seen those parts before,\\
Our being shakes with dubious recognition.\\
Thus Procris. Looking at the stranger’s face,\\
Apologetic sketch, she thought she saw,\\
As in the mirror’s flashing light, the truth.\\
Now Cephalus, his stratagem achieved,\\
Drunk poison with his glass of victory wine,\\
And saw a true but scorned fidelity\\
Deep branded on a disbelieving face.\\
‘Get out now,’ Procris said, ‘and never speak\\
Nor let me hear your false inventions more!\\
And take your sulphurous speech and rustic ruses!\\
They may have purchase with some other woman,\\
Fallen, and of your company.’ ‘I beg,’\\
Said Cephalus, ‘forgive or overlook\\
My childish error—and that is what it was—\\
Or lend me just a minute of your time:\\
I promise I will show the heart behind\\
The face.’ ‘There is no falsehood strange or sweet\\
With which to season off your mixture’s sourness,’\\
Said Procris, but before she could evict him,\\
He held his hair to show it wasn’t ruddy\\
At the root, then removed his left hand glove\\
And brought up to the light the wedding ring,\\
And Procris understood and was aghast.\\
‘My Cephalus with mask of crimson hair?\\
My honest Cephalus in false disguise?\\
With underhanded ploy? My Cephalus?\\
My Cephalus I thought had died? The one\\
For whom I made a patient life unlived,\\
For whom I kept the symbols of our love,\\
Defying eternity? That Cephalus?\\
The ice is struck, and truly it is shattered;\\
Eight years are in a single moment gone,\\
And love goes with them—to oblivion.’
