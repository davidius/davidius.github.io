# Canto I
In earliest morning—with Apollo still\\
Delayed, his steeds unwhipped, or barely moved,\\
The rosy tint of sky lately delivered\\
From night’s cold womb—so as to cheat the day,\\
The newly-married Cephalus, spear in hand,\\
Took up his horse and ventured to the hunt.\\
It seemed to him he was so early up\\
Even the lily and the rose were wrapped\\
In cloudy dreams, the veiling dew too idle\\
To scatter at the coming of the sun,\\
And last the larks themselves, the gatekeepers\\
Of reluctant day, seemed honestly to yawn\\
And shirk their task. This victory of time\\
Made Cephalus smile, and with an easy drift\\
Remembrances of bygone hunts returned,\\
Of escapades well bountied with full hauls\\
Of wildfowl of the stream and of the marsh,\\
Of spearing thrusts, transfixing thirty fish\\
With one attack, before attempting and\\
Achieving his great prize, the snorting boar,\\
Which, bloodied, swung attached to his proud horse\\
And would become a feast. But soon the silence\\
Disquieted, and he began to feel\\
Himself a night-thief in the lonely garden\\
Of helpless nature’s house. There was nearby,\\
Apart from him, one other soul awake:\\
Moving amid the early shadows, it was\\
Aurora, goddess of the dawn. This being\\
With restless fire skimmed the sleepy woods,\\
Her feet with independent motion sparing\\
The flowers unaware (who each awoke\\
In turn in daze), and panting tireless\\
She glided with insatiate haste—to what?\\
Herself she didn’t know, nor could she know,\\
Since gods are also blinded by the Fates\\
To the deep spring of action. When she saw\\
The fearful Cephalus upon his horse\\
She stopped; and as the sun pierces the dew\\
And all’s made clear, she finally saw the cause\\
Of respite’s end. To her the hunter,\\
Bound though he was by earthly limitation,\\
Seemed more than mortal man, to have the beauty\\
Gods themselves, upon Olympus’ height,\\
Desired, though few have power to realise.\\
She smiled a goddess’ smile, and called him on\\
With wafting voice, a siren she appeared\\
In charming robe, and by her words was made\\
The more alluring. ‘O traveller astray,’\\
She softly spoke, ‘why do you recede?\\
Shy stranger, come close: I am a woman only.\\
Tell me, is it game you look to find here?\\
For I have knowledge of this wooded world\\
And am the mistress of its many vales.\\
Do boar and deer perhaps elude you? Then trace\\
My flowery path through secret unknown thickets:\\
For there’s a grove unseen by mortal eye\\
With creatures numberless, and when the one\\
Is killed, another springs up from the soil\\
As Spartoi from the ground that grew to Thebes;\\
And when one dreams of sweet repose, a sweep\\
Of elements in harmony glides down\\
To grant it; then when dreams suggest those things\\
That daylight thinks impossible, upon\\
A golden table are they laid for you—\\
What reason have you not to follow me?’\\
She looked imploringly, but Cephalus\\
Returned a wary glance, and disbelieved\\
Or doubted her intent. ‘I’ll hunt alone,’\\
He said, and turned imperiously off\\
Before Aurora, injured, thus replied,\\
‘There’s nothing there but small and worthless creatures;\\
You cheat yourself and lose the time’s advantage\\
To search those fruitless groves. Forsake your pride:\\
The feast you’ll find with this one move will endless\\
Sate the mortal appetite.’ Now he,\\
Maintaining still his air of reticence,\\
Became intrigued by these divine words,\\
And wondered who this woman was who smiled\\
And beckoned him, and seemed to know the woods\\
Like it was her creation. ‘Follow me,’\\
She said with confidence, for he seemed weaker,\\
And looked as the defiant fort before\\
The shaking fall, ‘and you will never regret\\
The wonders that you’ll find.’ Now Cephalus\\
Became suspicious, and Aurora’s pose\\
And words appeared as more than talk of hunting,\\
For strange it were to offer the unlikely,\\
In such assured and godlike terms, so sudden.\\
Aurora, seeing this, pleaded thus:\\
‘O pity me, a forest maiden, lonely,\\
Mistrusted by the hunters I myself\\
Should fear! O gods upon Olympus! Shed\\
A sea of tears, admixed with wine-dark blood\\
Of piteous hearts! All these strong hunters, gods,\\
I only mean to help, yet they disdain,\\
Not knowing that their chosen patch is bare.\\
No fine arrays of reason wring compassion\\
Nor tender weeping words have power to move,\\
For men will not delight to know that sometimes\\
The better hunting is on ground unhunted.’\\
These words moved Cephalus; himself he scolded\\
That ever he should doubt this woman. Thus,\\
The mob of doubts dismissed, he rationalised:\\
‘I’ll only spend an hour in the grove.\\
For what’s an hour? What devilry conspires\\
In such a short elapsing? What conspiring\\
Is stuffed in such a breathless span of time?\\
I doubt there’s anything my spear will not\\
Ensnare, or that my horse cannot outrun.\\
The huge and terrible snake that Cadmus pierced?\\
Its kind is gone from Earth. The chimera?\\
These woods are not its climate. All monstrous things,\\
The worst children of the minds of gods, are dead,\\
Or in a distant land; I will not them\\
Consider for a moment more. I’ll on\\
To where this lady leads; and think my Procris,\\
When I return with thrice my usual game,\\
Shall three times gladder be than usual mornings.’\\
This resolution, paintedin the eye,\\
Aurora understood, and, without words,\\
She guided him away, through shades and thickets,\\
Through hidden paths and under ancient trees,\\
Until, the route full banished from his mind,\\
The grove was reached. It lay abundant, clothed\\
In pine and cypress, flowered with the range\\
Of nature’s craft, its arches carved in copy\\
Of man’s best work, but never given to man\\
To place upon his maps. The horses there,\\
The cows, the sheep, all grazed ambrosia\\
And supped content with the goddess of the Dawn,\\
Together resting, though free from daily toil.

This grove would prove to be, for eight long years,\\
The jail and cell and chains of Cephalus,\\
Since even when he dared to flee its charms\\
He always found himself returned. Eight years!\\
And every minute brought him images\\
Of Procris—Procris crying, Procris alone,\\
Procris over the gleaming precipice\\
Of hope, or Procris dead alone abandoned\\
And prey to elements. And every day\\
He entered his petitions with the Dawn,\\
And every day she promised: but each day passed,\\
And still he was deprived of Procris. His love,\\
When his detainment ended, was withered down\\
But still alive, though all his years of pining\\
Had finished off Aurora’s patience. ‘Leave!’\\
The goddess screamed, ‘return to precious Procris,\\
Forget me just as she’s forgotten you,\\
Go back to your prosaic, toiling life,\\
Destroy all charms from it! Pluck out the rose\\
And fling it to the wind! But now you must\\
Be burdened with this parting truth: although\\
You dream of her each night, from now these dreams\\
Shall be up to the throat stuffed full with pangs,\\
Suspicions, and regrets. Away!’ The path\\
Was disentangled now, and Cephalus,\\
As though he’d always known the way, returned\\
Back to the spot he saw Aurora first.\\
It was the evening time, and nature wrapped\\
The blanket of the dusk upon itself,\\
While Cephalus with trepidation looked\\
In the direction of his home. Those words\\
Of pangs, suspicions, regrets, corroded him.\\
‘Can they be more than angry weightless words?\\
Divinity is scarcely wrong concerning souls,\\
And yet the least of what I know of Procris\\
Is that of all the flock she is the truest.\\
The moon itself would shame to gaze on us\\
If she could hold such thoughts.’ Yet still he questioned,\\
The doubts like ivy spreading through his soul,\\
Consideration with consideration\\
Contending for supremacy, fearing\\
A dreaded truth for every possible path,\\
Until he felt resolved. ‘I know she’s faithful,’\\
He thought, ‘as are the never-erring stars,\\
But virtues never stand without a vice\\
Nearby, and angels sometimes are inclined\\
To fall into disgrace, therefore I’ll try\\
No devious stratagem or cunning tactic,\\
But mere disguise, and set an honest test.’
