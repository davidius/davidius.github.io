# Canto VII
The message was delivered; Procris knew.\\
Now in the very first, the glow was deep\\
Of love renewed, and so the invasive words,\\
Much like the first weak sallies of a siege,\\
When none suspect the horrors that will come,\\
Seemed only to bemuse. The misted air,\\
Pregnant with indirection, cleared itself,\\
And bare before her lay the soul of man.\\
And yet beholding it she found it strange:\\
‘Is this the total sum? The whole reduction?\\
The beating in the heart? A jealousy,\\
An infidelity, and nothing more?\\
Was this the thing that wove the charm of love,\\
That rendered to my eyes the worth of all\\
My sufferings? And now the same swoops down\\
And plucks it all away? But that is like\\
A full and bountied tree that bears no fruit,\\
Or like a heavy drenching rain that washes\\
Bare fields of plantless soil, replenishing\\
Nothing. No, no. The Fates may have their whims\\
And they may like to trick us, perhaps it is\\
Their sort of entertainment, but they are not\\
So arbitrary. I only have the word;\\
It stands alone and can be questioned, it is\\
Like any other thing, and there’s no reason\\
To think it more than fables for a child.\\
Imagination is a beast that coils\\
Around my heart, possessing me, which weakens\\
When truth is plain before the doubting eye.\\
Truth then must conquer it, or I must die.’\\
\\
Thus she resolved to go. Anticipating\\
The worst, her head engulfed itself with sweat,\\
And sometimes she could hardly broach her thought,\\
But still she trod the path. The forest shades\\
Together threw over all things a light\\
Transmutative, and as it’s said our ears\\
Are deafened to the music of the spheres,\\
Those sights she might have smiled to see, like birds\\
That chased their mates, and amorous butterflies\\
In endless dance, she passed with a kind of scorn.\\
It was with vanquished hope that Procris found\\
The haunt of Cephalus, where he still bathed,\\
Though with some air of guilt. He wasn’t now\\
Imperious, but agitated, full\\
Of self-reproach, and bidding Aura go.\\
But Procris could not see nor hear these details,\\
And only saw his nakedness and heard\\
His constant calls to Aura—and everything\\
Was as it was foretold. He dressed himself,\\
And as the breeze withdrew, alone his mind\\
Felt quite unclothed, and by a new alertness\\
He saw suspicious eyes in every shadow.\\
With stance of fortitude he tried to fend\\
These eyes away, until he closed his own\\
And sighed to recognise their pierce of truth.
