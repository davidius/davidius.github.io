# Canto V
Some gloried weeks were passed, with hand in hand\\
And solely in each otherâ€™s company.\\
The things that transpired then are hardly known\\
And little guessed at, but still we can be sure\\
They were such golden stuff as mortal man\\
And mortal woman hardly ever know. \\
They strove the daily hunt, and evening walks\\
Through misted fields, and silent apple-picking\\
Even through the deep of soundless night;\\
And all that passed around them was oblivion,\\
And all of life was in their dual bond.
