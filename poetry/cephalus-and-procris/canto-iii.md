# Canto III
Then Procris thought of where to go, some place\\
Where shame would never stalk, and where the mind\\
Of man could be forgotten. No place to her\\
But one was viable, the sacred grove\\
In ancient, distant woods she once had heard of,\\
In which Diana and her troop of nymphs\\
Were said to roam and hunt. Unburdened then\\
From doubt, and free as new-born child, or freer,\\
She left to find the grove. Her Cephalus\\
Remained in tow, and pleaded loud and long,\\
But Procris scarcely turned nor uttered word.\\
Two hours passed, and both had lost their way,\\
When Cephalus stopped, and looked about, and saw\\
That all around was lifeless desolation,\\
A quiet rain that killed the final ember.\\
The forest then was cold; it shivered him\\
To see, ghostlike, the image slow depart.\\
\\
Relief and pain at once in Procris’ mind\\
Found settlement; the louder rustling leaves\\
Conspiring how to hint her wandering way.\\
‘Where hides Diana in these leafy halls?\\
Where is that pure goddess I should have stitched\\
Infixed along the lining of my heart—\\
Back then?’ she said, believing none could hear.\\
She peered through flowery windows and meandered\\
Over the rosy beds through archways made\\
Of tangled branches, and asked again, ‘Diana!\\
Which of these lairs is yours?’ And then she heard\\
A sound: a bird that echoed her intonings,\\
A human-sounding bird and minister\\
Of Dian’s hidden band. Her thoughts were like\\
The dying light that played upon the leaves,\\
Through swelling night still clinging in its glow,\\
With quick suggestion pointing here then there,\\
Without resolve to stay; the bird was then\\
Exacerbator of confusion, and she\\
Could not tell west from east. So she went on,\\
With tuned ear she went on, hearing again\\
The bird’s uncanny voice, but with a doubt\\
She set it to her side and questioned still\\
Where lay that bowery grove, the sun of all\\
Her life. Then a dissimulation of birds\\
Together flew, and Procris saw a stream,\\
The wending sound of which she heard just then,\\
And all her instincts told her, ‘follow, follow’.\\
Its cooling sound and air silenced the noise\\
Of Procris’ mind, and with a timeless breeze\\
She walked, and walked. Her legs began to feel\\
A trudging pain; the fleeing of the world\\
Was harsh renunciation; and yet the sound,\\
The slow and drowsy sound of water streaming,\\
Was sedative. And she was so enraptured\\
In Lethean state that when she saw the grove\\
She almost passed it by. But Dian stood\\
In waiting expectation, naked, with smile\\
Divine, surrounded by her nymphs, and beckoned.\\
‘Only the lost are so intuitive,’\\
Diana said, ‘as to locate us here.\\
And only those in tangled growth of thought\\
Can navigate the knotted ways to us.\\
What is it, then, stray creature, that draws your sense\\
Towards our grove, so covertly ensconced?’\\
At this the cheeks of Procris filled with blood,\\
Her consciousness injected with a flush\\
Of shame, and she could hardly speak but stuttered:\\
‘Forgive me my presumption; you are the high\\
Goddess of hunting and the moon, and I\\
Am merely woman; but I’ve often heard\\
This grove a sanctuary to fugitives\\
From love, and I was hoping—you must forgive me,\\
I am a foolish girl, and very tired\\
From hours of hopeless search, and so my words\\
May not be very capable of sense.\\
I’ve come to escape—I mean—I mean I was,\\
Until today, a wedded woman, linked\\
To one man and to one existence, until\\
That man undid the fabled tapestry,\\
Thus stamping our disunion.’ (But still, she thought,\\
There is no trick of man to rival that\\
On my own self by that same self.) ‘I waited,\\
And for no year of that interminable eight\\
Did air reprieve the ash of dying hope.\\
In time my husband Cephalus returned\\
Disguised in unknown clothes—with foreign force\\
He tried his cunning to woo me—and with such tricks\\
Committed all our love in withered ashes\\
To the abysmal wind. That’s why I’m here.’\\
All this Diana knew and understood,\\
But still some ember in the eye of Procris\\
Disquieted her soul, and made her doubt\\
How far renounced was Procris.  ‘And are you sure,’\\
Diana said, ‘there is no hope of healing?’\\
A moment’s thought, and Procris said, ‘there’s none.’\\
With this Dian admitted Procris into\\
The circle of her nymphs, conferring gifts\\
Of never-failing spear and Laelaps, a hound\\
Who never erred in hunting, and there began\\
A short and blissful age, with scarce a thought\\
For Cephalus (a bare remembrance of\\
His name), in which the time forgetfully\\
Was skimmed as though a stone along the surface\\
Of the great sea, with hunting and with bathing,\\
And nothing to remind of Cephalus.
