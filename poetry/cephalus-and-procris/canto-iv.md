# Canto IV
In quiet desolation Cephalus,\\
Some nights after the split, and brooding long\\
Over his act, sought out his will, till then\\
Reachless beneath a lake of ice.The house\\
Entrapped his guilt and memory like time,\\
The fly in the web of walls, and candlelight\\
Entreated him to unwilled solitude. \\
Some force with gentle pinch suggested him\\
His way to sweet reunion, but was fought\\
By forces of opposing voice and doubt.\\
‘Horror to think how I’ll appear to her,’\\
He thought, ‘an apparition of the night,\\
Strong figment populating fevered dreams,\\
A scar along her skin of life, reminder\\
Of all the stolen unreturnable years\\
Beginning with a glance. And also with me\\
How permanent her ghostly lodging! How looming\\
Stands now her visage in every hall of memory,\\
A blank reminder of my act, desiring\\
To cry, but left unable! But what of me,\\
Such images becoming my daily haunt,\\
My soul abandoned and my fields a relic\\
To time’s quick jealousy? I’ll reach old age\\
A fraction of the years, and I’ll be as\\
Those bearded few I carelessly passed by\\
Without a speculation or a pause\\
To my brief happiness.’ That last word shook him,\\
He momentarily forgot his fear\\
And almost left, until he looked again\\
And saw the icy shell that Procris left,\\
And guilt untrammelled stopped his heart. But he\\
Kept still encouraged and accepted the logic\\
Of flashing impulse. ‘Which other path to take?’\\
He said with new resilience looking out,\\
‘A final effort calls me to the bounds\\
Of life, between extremes of love and death,\\
A final foray through the endless ocean\\
Where I might in a tempest drown, or live\\
To see that island of eternal bliss.’\\
Just as the rays of dawn bid night pass on,\\
His heart was seasoned with reviving herbs\\
And sprang up with a tentative refreshment,\\
Perhaps as beings out of hibernation,\\
Straining for light; but Cephalus knew well\\
Its fickleness, and so foresightedly\\
He caged all doubtful and devouring thought\\
To save his shieldless heart. Then by the brand\\
Of luck that led his Procris blindly through\\
The twisted wood, he wended with the stream\\
And found Diana’s grove.\\
\\
              The goddess bathed\\
Naked among her flock of nymphs (just so\\
They all were playing in a clear-blue pond),\\
And with a sudden motion stood, seeming\\
To mute as those within the Gorgon’s gaze,\\
Causing the new intruder rapt surprise.\\
He looked above, then to the left or right,\\
And in such flitting never settled on\\
A single object, the butterflies and birds\\
Lacking power to still his soul. Diana,\\
Remaining still unmoved, began to speak:\\
‘What mortal is this, happening on our lair?\\
Have men not learnt from history, from my\\
Conversion of that wayward fool Actaeon\\
Into a stag? Nature has mysteries\\
That must be kept mysterious, and secrets\\
Mankind should never know. The sacred things\\
Must thus remain, away from such intrusions.’\\
These words, it seemed, were not addressed solely\\
To Cephalus or to the silent nymphs,\\
But rather to the general air, as though\\
Fit only for the ears of the immortals.\\
‘I’m sorry, lady,’ said Cephalus, forgetting\\
Actaeon’s tragic metamorphosed fate\\
And that its perpetrator stood before him\\
Reminding him and issuing fair warning,\\
‘I meant no interruption; by accident\\
I happen here, in search of my lost wife.\\
These woods are known for apparitions and boars:\\
She’ll not survive her fragile disposition\\
For longer than escape these threats. Her name\\
Is Procris. Have you seen her?’ But Procris now\\
Was rapt forgetful, picking flowers, gone\\
Far past the sight of man, and so Diana,\\
In veil of innocence, said, ‘There was one\\
Who passed here solemnly some time ago.\\
She gave herself the name of Lost. But by\\
A profound magic, in so identifying\\
She was transformed to Found. How very strange!\\
What shall we make of it? You look for Lost;\\
I only know of Found.’ Still ignorant who\\
This woman was, standing naked in water,\\
With riddles for her sentences and disdain\\
Prevailing as her demon, Cephalus\\
Replied, ‘her name is Procris.’ Diana laughed,\\
And said, ‘our names are on our skin, but what\\
Is on our hearts?’ ‘The truth,’ said Cephalus.\\
‘Then I shall call for her. O Truth? O Truth?\\
Does Truth reside here in these woods? Come out,\\
O Truth that’s hopefully nearby!—Alas:\\
Perhaps she’s coy before us blunderers.\\
Perhaps a soothing song is what is called for.’\\
‘I’ll look for her myself,’ said Cephalus,\\
Disturbed. ‘A better plan,’ the goddess said,\\
‘Not even gods can light that path for man.’\\
\\
So Cephalus, exasperated, called out,\\
‘Procris! Procris! Procris!’ which echoed through\\
The chambered wood, until the very last\\
Of these reverberations, nearly silent,\\
Reached Procris’ ear—who damned her backward mind\\
For these reminders. She was picking flowers\\
Amid the mist-strewn orchard, and on the plucking\\
Of one particular daisy, a drifting song\\
From days of past alighted on her mind:\\
With fullest throat my daisy sings\\
More true and strange by far\\
Than every dusty tome and word\\
Set down beneath the Star.\\
And while the shady welkin mourns,\\
The lady of my flower\\
Stands resolutely on and sings\\
Deep in the darkened bower.\\
‘But I have stolen it! Where can it grow?’\\
What song is it she sings, you say?\\
What angles so her soul?\\
It is the love which moves the Earth,\\
The sparrows, worms, and foals.\\
The forests and the boundless plains,\\
The frozen deserts all,\\
The smallest ant and greatest god\\
In her dominion fall.\\
Then with a dying arc, she, kneeling down,\\
Returned the flower to its mother soil:\\
‘But was it me who killed it? Was it not—’\\
‘Procris! Procris!’—thus came the falling echoes\\
Of nearing Cephalus’s voice—‘Procris!’\\
‘What does it profit me,’ she thought aloud,\\
‘To mock these withered petals with the hope,\\
The blighted hope, of resurrection? I waste\\
The passing time, the enemy of life,\\
Which wastes all life itself despite the soil\\
And its embrace, and tender kiss of sun,\\
And all for what? One time I thought I saw\\
A general commanding love in triumph\\
Over the force of hate, but that alike\\
Was merely a vision, and a mockery.’\\
Again was heard the echo of the call—\\
‘Procris! Procris!’, and louder than before.\\
‘Is that his voice? But how could he have found me?’\\
The flower was forgotten then, and Procris\\
Raised up her head in blushing expectation,\\
Now seeing through the trees a brief mirage,\\
Now seeing nothing, till,as though a spectre,\\
The searching Cephalus materialised.\\
‘But is that you?’ asked Procris then, before\\
She shuddered to recall his bald deceit,\\
And hardened her defence. Then Cephalus:\\
‘It is, and yet is not. If “Cephalus”\\
Is deemed alone to name that blundering fool\\
Who with suspicion hitherto unknown\\
Struck down like Jove’s great lightning on a meadow\\
Marked, as it was, by peace, then I am not he,\\
And he is alien. But if that name\\
Means this new chastened man, made wise by fires,\\
Who still retains that early bud of love\\
Now flowered with experience, then yes,\\
I am that Cephalus: I am returned.’\\
He noted doubt in her, which seemed to him\\
As when a child with tentative step mistrusts\\
The adult who has tricked her. He wanted then\\
To talk at greater length, to give the notes\\
He’d taken down while they had been apart,\\
And to deliver them with such abundance\\
That nobody could doubt their truth—except\\
He saw her hopeful face, a fragile vase\\
Which he could not risk shattering with words.\\
Now Procris’ heart and brain were speaking separate:\\
The one with message of reunion beating\\
Loudly, loudly; the other whispering\\
To read his eyes with care. She closed her eyes,\\
Perceiving vatic visions of the time\\
To come: its happiness, but still the taint\\
Of momentary error unerased—\\
Concluding that in any case this world\\
And this humanity would have to bear\\
Some load of guilt in memory of our vice,\\
Lest it should walk around forgetful dazed\\
Amid delusory innocence. This change\\
Was shadowed on her face, and Cephalus\\
Intuited some change, and felt at once\\
The pull of Procris’ warmth and estrangement’s chill.\\
Now in the shadow of a maple tree\\
The pair were reconciled, both with each other\\
And with themselves. The gifts of hound and spear\\
That Procris had received from Dian’s hand\\
She passed along to Cephalus as symbols\\
Of old renouncement new-renounced. The goddess,\\
With a benevolent smile, released her pupil\\
Out of the obligations of her school,\\
And sent them on to what seemed destined love.
