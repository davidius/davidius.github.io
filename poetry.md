The following are two narrative poems which are almost certain to seal my fame forever. But don't let that sway your judgement either way.

## Cosimo and Filippa

Concerns the fates of two fictional lovers in Renaissance Italy during the time of Charles VIII's invasion.

> Oft said it is that in the glow of moon,\\
In blazing night, when crickets restless sing\\
(And all of nature eavesdrops to the sound),\\
When humid air from oriental lands\\
Reigns over like an omnipresent king,\\
And we’re like captives exiled from our sleeps—\\
That on such fertile earth will love be sown.\\
In such a time and state will lovers rise\\
To follow airy scents they know not where,\\
To sniff the flowers drooping over walls,\\
To write upon the tablets of their minds\\
Melodious sonnets never apt enough\\
For capturing the rhythms of their hearts—\\
And yet such bitter taste amalgamate\\
With sweet, to look upon the night and lack,\\
To sigh the air, to think upon a kiss:\\
That is the poison hidden in the tail.

## Cephalus and Procris

Based on the story related by Ovid in the _Metamorphoses_.

> In earliest morning—with Apollo still\\
Delayed, his steeds unwhipped, or barely moved,\\
The rosy tint of sky lately delivered\\
From night’s cold womb—so as to cheat the day,\\
The newly-married Cephalus, spear in hand,\\
Took up his horse and ventured to the hunt.\\
It seemed to him he was so early up\\
Even the lily and the rose were wrapped\\
In cloudy dreams, the veiling dew too idle\\
To scatter at the coming of the sun,\\
And last the larks themselves, the gatekeepers\\
Of reluctant day, seemed honestly to yawn\\
And shirk their task. This victory of time\\
Made Cephalus smile, and with an easy drift\\
Remembrances of bygone hunts returned,\\
Of escapades well bountied with full hauls\\
Of wildfowl of the stream and of the marsh,\\
Of spearing thrusts, transfixing thirty fish\\
With one attack, before attempting and\\
Achieving his great prize, the snorting boar,\\
Which, bloodied, swung attached to his proud horse\\
And would become a feast. But soon the silence\\
Disquieted, and he began to feel\\
Himself a night-thief in the lonely garden\\
Of helpless nature’s house. There was nearby,\\
Apart from him, one other soul awake:\\
Moving amid the early shadows, it was\\
Aurora, goddess of the dawn...
