## Welcome to Davidius's GitHub page

Currently, I am hosting two projects here on GitHub. 

The first is [Means of Production](https://github.com/davidius/Means-of-Production). It's an all-in-one productivity app that allows you to do pomodoros, track your productivity, set reminders, and much more. 

The second is [Ketchup or Catsup](https://github.com/davidius/Ketchup-or-Catsup), a simple shopping list app made in React.js.

I am hard at work on other exciting projects, and shall add them here shortly, so watch this space.
