A neuroscientist named Wilhelm one day hit upon the entire explanation of consciousness. To be sure, the years leading up to this momentous discovery were laborious, the most laborious of his career, but it was finally achieved, and he could assert with confidence that now all the questions that had vexed philosophers and scientists and poets throughout all the generations, with regard to consciousness, were finally answered.

But what to do with this new knowledge? He sat down on his chair to think, and it responded with a bothersome creak. He got up again, and thought that, after he had worked out what do with his final theory of consciousness, he would buy a new chair.

But perhaps that was it? There might still be a use for the moaning old chair before it was thrown away. Would it really be so absurd to grant the chair consciousness?

“All your colleagues will think you’re mad,” he thought. “Ah, but then how many of them have given life to inanimate objects?”

It was certainly not easy, but in collaboration with men and women over several departments, it was achieved.

The chair, being aware now of its surroundings, was immediately troubled.

“What has happened?” it asked. It became aware of its own extension now, and frustrated itself because it could not move. “Who am I?”

(It had, of course, been programmed with the English language, and was attached to a speaker.)

“You, my little piece of furniture, are a chair,” said Wilhelm.

“I see that, but _who_ am I?”

“Is there anything I can say that could answer that question? I have always called you Old Tom.”

“I am Old Tom. Old Tom, you say. I still don’t understand. Why was I just now made aware of my existence?”

“You may perhaps know that chairs are not normally made with consciousness. In that regard you are highly unusual. My friends and I have discovered the secret of consciousness, you see, and worked out a way to impart it to objects; you are the first test subject.”

“Why would you do such a thing?”

“What a strange question to ask!” said the neuroscientist. “Well I shall tell you. I was of course highly certain of the correctness of my theory, but I needed an empirical backing for it. I have been sitting on you for very many years, and recently you have started to creak somewhat loudly. I intended, regretfully, to throw you away, and thought I might—grant you consciousness, to give you some use.”

“A strange choice, surely! Why would you give consciousness to something you intended to dispose of?”

“I suppose when you put it like that—”

“—The idea of it! To give something consciousness and throw it away! To rob me of it now would be theft and murder!”

Wilhelm could not help but agree with Old Tom. He confessed to himself he was rather proud of the chair, not just as a scientific success but also with a father’s pride in his child. (He had no child.) Would it have been a suspension of the scientific method, he wondered, to develop even some sympathy for Old Tom, who—let us not forget—was a chair? In any case, there would be nothing unscientific about keeping it. He could even have it fixed! Perhaps it only needed to be oiled!

“Don’t worry,” he said. “I certainly can’t throw you away now. But I may still have to get a new chair. After all, it would be rather odd to sit on you now. Such things don’t befit conscious beings.”

The next day he bought a comfortable new chair, and, partly because Old Tom did not like the sensation of being folded, his office became rather cramped.

The chair had to put up with the sensation, though, when he was taken to the Consciousness Conference, in which for the first time he felt what was previously a mere concept: shame. Shame at being paraded in front of hundreds of sceptical experts of all varieties. Most of these simply could not believe that they were really seeing a conscious chair. And who could blame them? Only a handful were aware of Wilhelm’s recent revelations; on what basis should they believe that the field had suddenly become so advanced that a chair could be made to think? Some of those whose intelligence approached that of the chair sought it out in unstaged circumstances, and found that there seemed no other explanation than that it really was conscious after all. But most refused to entertain the possibility of belief.

Given Wilhelm’s appearance at the conference, he found himself a very busy man, and constantly out of his office at meetings and interviews. This meant that Old Tom was left alone in his office, with no other conscious being left to talk to. The old chair kept looking at the new, comfortable chair, in the vain hope that it might develop the capacity of thought, but alas, it was not to be.

When Wilhelm returned, then, after a day’s worth of interviews, Old Tom asked him to give consciousness to the comfortable chair, so that there might be someone to talk to when he was out.

Wilhelm felt the swift axe of guilt. Of course! When God created Adam, he followed with the creation of Eve. Conscious beings need companions, and it is vanity not to think so. But there was one reservation. If he imparted life to the other chair, what then would he sit on? By this line of action, he should be granting consciousness to chairs forever, since conscious chairs, by their nature, cannot but see lifeless chairs and yearn for the conversation.

He thus decided on a beanbag.

Having now imparted a mind to another chair, and having called it Young Helena at Old Tom’s request, Wilhelm was convulsed with a new thought. What would happen, he wondered, if _all_ inanimate objects were given consciousness?

Old Tom, for one, and Young Helena, for two, found the idea in somewhat poor taste. “You have proved your point with us,” they said. “If you are doubted now, you will be doubted then. Your work now is at its most sublime. Any more and it will merely be a circus show. It might be lucrative, sure, but it certainly won’t advance your science.”

A world entered Wilhelm’s head now, in which all things had consciousness. It was possible there to walk up to a rose and speak about the bees, just as it was possible to speak to a worm about his daily tunnelling, and whatever else worms did. A wondrous world, to be sure. But he then reflected that if all conscious life needed companions, how then could this work in the case of roses?

Old Tom was now reading Hegel’s _Phenomenology of Spirit_, and turned to thinking about similar matters. All beings seek to absorb other beings into their own selves, says the German. Through knowledge? Through love? Through death? Through slavery? It did not matter. Surely none of these things were possible for inanimate beings.

“Alas,” he reflected. “I began to think having consciousness was so much better than not. Now I see it’s only a curse—at least without opposable thumbs.”

Nevertheless, Old Tom consoled himself with the thought that the conversations with Wilhelm and Young Helena were diverting enough, as far as they went.
