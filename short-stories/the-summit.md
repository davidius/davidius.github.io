Wang-Chin was but a boy when the fishing town that he called Home was invaded. Roars and thunder – the armies of the Japanese came, and all (that is _all_) was burnt to ash but a few things. His family was one of those few things, but they feared starvation because the fish, too, had been burnt. Thus the bell of time had struck, and all the elderly wise people strongly advised that this deed be revenged, preferably by someone young.

Wang, being the least harmed in the town, and feeling that he had reached adulthood, took this grave responsibility upon himself. So he finished off his sweet and sour with more urgency than usual; as he filled his stomach and as he felt the weight of his endeavour heavily upon himself, his wise father, lying on his bed, too injured to get up, spoke his last memorable words to him: “whatever you do, my son, you must ultimately ensure, above all else in this world, that you – ahem!” – and he began a minute-long series of coughs – “this” – cough – “damned cough keeps” – cough – “stopping me mid-sentence.” Cough. He finally stopped coughing. “What was I saying again?”

His mother smiled knowingly at him, as if to say that whatever his father wanted to tell him, it surely could wait, but finding the Japanese couldn’t. With a bewildered expression upon his young face, he left.

For days he journeyed in the wilderness, following an old battered path that had seemed unused for centuries, scraping a diet from the few edible plants and the little resourcefulness he had. He hadn’t gone far (in the grand scheme of things) when he spied on a conversation being conversed by spies. Who else but the treacherous Japanese, so full of treachery? He hid in the high grass and noted it all. The conqueror’s plans he now knew and he readied himself with a strong branch from a strong tree, so as to fight his way across high seas to Kyoto. The night came and he pictured his enemies ambushing him. He swiped at air with the branch, anger filling his heart. But he was not aware, for someone was spying on _him_.

As he awoke, he found that standing over him was an old man with a particularly long beard and even longer eyebrows. “Foolish child,” said he, as he stroked his beard, “foolish, foolish child.”

“Please, elaborate,” replied Wang sarcastically.

“I saw you in the night-time, anger filling your heart, trying to assassinate flies with your stick. I have seen many like you, child, that have fallen to the lethal blade of the samurai. They had all the same mission.”

“You mean revenge?”

“Revenge? Well, I was going to say killing flies, but I suppose revenge is fine. Anyway, the point is, foolish one, that you must clear your heart of anger before you can engage in combat, for if not, the enemy will destroy you with one flick of his finger. Look up at that mountain, child.”

Wang looked up, somewhat begrudgingly, at the aforementioned mountain.

“You must be as the mountain,” said the master.

“How do you mean – really really tall?”

“No.”

“Spiky?”

“No.”

“Then what?”

“Extremely strong, and unconquerable. Nothing in nature can defeat it, except the wrathful tides of the Yellow Sea, but they have not the intelligence to get to it. Notice also, that it need not move to win – it stands rooted to the very earth, tall above all things, and tempts us to conquer it. Yet nothing in its design – its rocky sharp edges, its tall unbreachable walls – nothing lends itself to defeat. So how do you defeat the mountain?”

“I don’t know.”

“Think about it, child, and you shall possess the answer.”

With that, he left into the wilderness speedily. It was pointless to chase him. Wang was left to ponder.

He had progressed much in his journey, and in his mind. Still, in every moment of peace he could hear in his imagination the tides of the Yangtze River crash upon him. The question of the bearded man he still asked himself, and the answer he still pined for. If he knew how to defeat the mountain, he could revenge the invaders.

The watery sounds he still heard, but this time they were real; for he had stumbled across a waterfall which, on closer examining, revealed there to be a man meditating underneath it.

“You must be as the water,” said the man, and immediately Wang recognised him.

“How do you mean – really really wet?”

“No.”

“Bubbly?”

“No.”

“Then what?”

“Fluid, and manoeuvrable. It appears to be weak, yet it can take any form it so wishes, and thus fool the foolish. It can be calm, yet it can be wrathful, and it may wear down any cliff. It can douse the most furious fire, and drown the most arrogant city.”

If water was indeed so powerful, Wang thought, why then was the bearded man standing directly underneath it? “Uh, thanks for that information,” said he, “but I should really be going now.”

“Wait!” shouted the master, “before you administer your blow, you must seek the famed man of the mountains, for his wisdom shall enlighten you beyond any upon Chinese soil.”

As he traversed the plains with his destination vaguely in sight, it was now the darkest time of night and his figure was only just visible as an unclear black silhouette against a slightly less black background. Nature was at peace but his mind was not, for it was brooding on that most ugly of things – not his nose, but revenge. The old man’s question he continued to ask himself. How do you defeat the mountain? Where must you strike so the whole thing crumbles down? If you strike the peak, the rest of it stands. Then again it is impossible to strike the base, being so massive…

Some weeks had passed, and Wang, who had heeded the advice of the old master, had arrived very near the peak of the mountain feeling much weaker, much hungrier, and not a whole lot wiser. Well, when you’re weak and hungry, wisdom isn’t exactly your top priority. It was difficult to see too, for he was in the clouds, and the clouds were in constant movement. Occasionally he saw very little, and occasionally he saw nothing. At one of the times when he saw little, he looked up and saw a small house balancing itself on the peak. But just as it was revealed, it was concealed again. Some minutes had passed, and a man came out of it, asking of Wang, “what do you seek, my child, that you could not have found thousands of feet below?”

“I seek the counsel of the great man of the mountains.”

“Well that’s lucky – I was just about to move to a slightly lower mountain. Perhaps even a hill. More convenient, you know.”

“You are the man of the mountains?” But he required no reply; as soon as he asked the question, he recognised the man’s face – it was the old master looking at him with a light-hearted smile and stroking his beard.

“What counsel do you seek? For as the mouse being chased by the cat, I am somewhat pressed for time.”

“I must know how to defeat the mountain, so that I can avenge the deaths of my neighbours, and see that justice be done.”

“Hmm,” replied the master, “I did ask you to figure that out for yourself, but, well, I suppose you did climb this mountain with no assistance…”

The master further stroked his beard, then continued. “Well alright, but you’re not going to understand this. The answer is time.”

“Time? How d’you mean, time?”

“The mountain is unassailable, so you must be patient and bide your time, waiting simply for luck to save you.”

“You mean I should just do nothing and wait?”

“Exactly! Listen: life is hard enough without giving yourself extra stuff to worry about! Oh, Confucius! This is my philosophy – I hope you’ll understand – why do now what you can do later? Why even _try_ to defeat the mountain in the first place? I mean, look at it! What harm has it ever done to you except look so damn beautiful?”

“What harm? I shall tell you what harm: my hometown has been burnt to ashes, leaving my neighbours dead, my family starving, and my father incapable of motion, but apart from that you got me.”

“Hold on there. That was the Japanese army, not the mountain!” The master reached out and put his hand on Wang’s forehead. “Poor, confused child…”

Wang gaped wide-mouthed and in silence, then sighed in anger. “What a waste,” he said, “what a waste.”

“No waste. You learned very important lesson of life.”

“Yeah, never trust old men who stroke their beards.”

With that, he walked off and did not say goodbye. Never again would he listen to a so-called wise person and their silly metaphors. Defeat a mountain? Honestly.
